        "p1": "Elena Stallings, Jesús López Alcalde, Iván Sola, Laura XX, Noelia Álvarez-Diaz, Javier Zamora",
        "h2": "Background",
        "p2": "Prognosis research is the investigation of the relationship between future outcomes (endpoints) among individuals with a given baseline health state (start point) (Riley et al. 2019). This research is becoming significantly more important as throughout the world, people are living longer, but with more chronic health conditions and diseases. Prognosis research can be classified into four different themes or areas of research: fundamental prognostics, prognostic models, stratified medicine, and prognostic factors (Riley et al. 2019). Fundamental prognosis research signifies the course of health-related conditions in the context of the type and quality of current care (Hemingway et al. 2013). Prognostic model research refers to the development, validation, and impact of statistical models which predict an individual’s risk of a future outcome (Steyerberg et al. 2013). Stratified medicine uses prognostic information to aid in adapting treatment decisions to an individual or a group of individuals with similar characteristics (Hingorani et al. 2013). Prognostic factor research studies specific factors that are associated with prognosis (Hemingway et al. 2013, Riley et al. 2013).",
        "p3": "A prognostic factor is a variable associated with the risk of a subsequent health outcome among people with a specific health condition. Prognostic factor research is a relatively new field of research. For example, if you search “prognostic factor” and “systematic review” in title in PubMed only 70 items are retrieved. In comparison if you search for systematic reviews of interventions in PubMed the search will retrieve 998 records (as of September 2019).  Systematic reviews are valuable resources as they summarize all relevant studies on specific clinical questions. However finding all information to include in systematic reviews can be challenging with an overwhelming amount of info and studies available (Kastner et al. 2009).",
        "p4": "Retrieving information from bibliographic databases such as PubMed or Embase can be very time consuming and the screening process in systematic reviews can be quite exhaustive when more than 30,000 references are retrieved (Riley et al. 2019). This is especially true when many articles are retrieved which are irrelevant to the research question. To combat this, methodological search filters have been developed to find articles related to various types of clinical questions (Geersing et al. 2012, Beynon et al. 2013). A search filter is a predefined combination of search terms designed to retrieve information on a particular topic. The job of a search filter is to retrieve information related to a specific concept. This concept could be a topic, a study design or a methodology (Harbour et al. 2014).",
        "p5": "Search filters attempt to increase the precision of searches and to reduce the resources that are required to screen the results. At the moment, there are various filters publicly available on medical research databases such as PubMed in the form of “clinical queries”. Methodological search filters can often be referred to as hedges, optimal search strategies, optimal search filters, search filters or clinical queries (Jenkins 2004). The word methodological search filter was originally created by Wilczynski et al. who defined it as “a search term or terms (such as “random allocation” for sound studies of medical intervention) that select studies that are at the most advanced stages of testing for clinical application’ (Wilczynski et al. 1993). Search filters are usually combined into a search strategy using the “AND” Boolean operator.",
        "p6": "The various methods used for developing search filters are characterized by generation (Jenkins 2004). First generation filters use non-objective methods as these are developed by librarians based solely on their expertise in bibliographic searches, but with no validation process. Second generation filters are developed in a similar manner, however in this development process the filters are validated using a gold standard or reference set. Third generation filters are developed based on statistical approaches and then validated against the gold standard which makes them the most objective type of filter (Jenkins 2004).",
        "p7": "There are 4 common methodological key elements within search filter design which will be discussed in detail in the methods section: identification of a ‘gold standard’; search term selection; evaluation of the search filter and validation (Jenkins 2004). Beynon et al identified 3 sources of possible bias in filter development. These sources are: 1) If systematic reviews were used to compile the reference set, these SRs must not have used a filter (for example in our case a prognosis filter); 2) The choice of the gold standard records are subject to high bias if they are topic specific and not generalizable; 3) The validation of the filter should be carried out using a separate reference set (validation set) (Beynon et al. 2013).",
        "h3": "Objectives",
        "p8": "To develop, evaluate and validate a search filter for prognostic factor studies. The main objective is to achieve maximum sensitivity so as not to lose any relevant studies when using the filter, while maintaining specificity. Generally, sensitivity and specificity are double edged swords, increasing sensitivity usually leads to decreased specificity, i.e. the identification of less relevant studies.",
        "p9": "The filter details will be fine-tuned in order to optimize sensitivity /(broadness) and/or specificity (narrowness)."
