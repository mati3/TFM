AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma regularly induces bone metastases that are responsible for impaired quality of life as well as significant morbidity, including bone pain and fractures. We aimed at identifying whether bone and metabolic biomarkers were associated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with synchronous bone metastases., PATIENTS AND METHODS: POUMOS is a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and synchronous bone metastases. All patients underwent biopsy of bone metastases to confirm diagnosis, including genotyping of oncogenic drivers such as EGFR and KRAS. Whole-body composition was assessed using DEXA scan. Serum levels of C-reactive protein, HbA1C, calcaemia, sCTX, and DKK1 were also measured., RESULTS: Sixty four patients, aged (mean+/-SD) 65+/-11years, were included. Thirty-nine (61%) patients had a good performance status (PS 0-1); 56% had >5 bone lesions, and 41% a weight-bearing bone (femour or tibia) involvement. Median overall survival was 7months. In multivariate analysis, HbA1c (HR=1.69 [1.10-2.63] per 0.5% decrease; p=.02), DKK1 (HR=1.28 [1.01-1.61] per 10ng/mL increase; p=.04), and hypercalcaemia (HR=2.83 [1.10-7.30]; p=.03) were independently associated with poorer survival. In the subgroup of patients with DEXA, sarcopenia was also associated with poorer survival (HR=2.96, 95%CI [1.40-6.27]; p=.005)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lung adenocarcinoma and synchronous bone metastases, bone, sarcopenia, and metabolic parameters were predictors of poor overall survival independently of common prognostic factors. We suggest that, in addition to oncological therapy, supportive treatment dedicated to bone metastases, muscle wasting, and energy metabolism are essential to improve prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sarcopenia is suggested to be associated with cancer-related inflammation. We assessed the clinical outcome of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients according to sarcopenia and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)., METHODS: A total of 117 male SCLC patients treated with first-line chemo- or chemoradiotherapy were assessed based on a retrospective chart review. The mass of the pectoralis muscle was measured by computed tomography and normalized to height. Patients with the lowest quartile of muscle mass were considered to have sarcopenia. Patients were classified into four groups according to their sarcopenia and NLR statuses: sarcopenia/high NLR, sarcopenia/low NLR, non-sarcopenia/high NLR, and non-sarcopenia/low NLR., RESULTS: Sarcopenic patients had lower progression-free survival (PFS) than did non-sarcopenic patients (median 6.0 vs. 7.5 months, p = 0.009), but the difference in overall survival (OS) was not statistically significant (median 10.5 vs. 13.5 months, p = 0.052). However, the OS of sarcopenic patients with high NLR was significantly lower than that in all other groups (median 3.2 vs. 16.0 vs. 12.5 vs. 13.7 months, respectively, p < 0.001), as was PFS (median 3.2 vs. 7.7 vs. 7.6 vs. 7.1 months, respectively, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, sarcopenia with high NLR was an independent prognostic factor for shorter PFS and OS. Early discontinuation of treatment (20.0 vs. 10.3 %) and treatment-related mortality (50.0 vs. 8.4 %) occurred more frequently in these patients than in the other groups (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In SCLC, sarcopenic male patients with high NLR have a poor prognosis and do not tolerate standard treatment. Intensive supportive care is needed in these patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of computed tomography (CT)-determined sarcopenia in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients., METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of a total of 149 consecutive SCLC patients. The cross-sectional area of muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was measured using baseline CT images. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 muscle index of less than 55 cm/m for men and of less than 39 cm/m for women as proposed by international consensus of cancer cachexia. In addition, Korean-specific cutoffs for sarcopenia was also applied (49 cm/m for men and 31 cm/m for women). Overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics of patients with or without sarcopenia were compared., RESULTS: Mean patient age was 68.6 +/- 9.5 years. Most were male (85.3%) and 67.8% had extensive disease at time of diagnosis. Sarcopenia was present in 118 patients (79.2%) and was significantly related to an advanced age (p = 0.028), male sex (p < 0.001), lower body mass index (p < 0.001), and poor performance status (p = 0.049). Sarcopenic patients had shorter OS than nonsarcopenic patients (median: 8.6 months versus 16.8 months; p = 0.031). Multivariable analysis revealed that sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (hazards ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.72; p = 0.034), along with extensive stage (p < 0.001), supportive care only (p < 0.001), and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.020). Using Korean sarcopenia cutoffs, sarcopenic patients were also found to have poorer OS than nonsarcopenic patients, however, the survival difference was not statistically significant (median: 8.4 months versus 12.7 months; p = 0.144 by the log-rank test)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia as determined by CT could be used to predict prognosis in patients with SCLC. Optimum reference values to predict cancer-specific outcomes should be tailored by further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, reduced skeletal muscle mass, is associated with frailty, injuries, and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of computed tomography-determined sarcopenia on surgical complications and outcomes after resection of non-small cell lung cancer., METHODS: For a total 272 non-small cell lung cancer patients that underwent surgery between 2011 and 2016, cross-sectional area of muscle at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was retrospectively measured using preoperative chest computed tomography images. Sarcopenia was defined as an L3 muscle index of <55 cm2/m2 for men and of <39 cm2/m2 for women. Clinical characteristics, postoperative complications, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients with or without sarcopenia were compared., RESULTS: A total of 60.3% ( n = 164) were male, and mean patient age was 62.9 +/- 9.6 years. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 22.4% for all study subjects, 32.9% for men, and 6.5% for women. No significant difference was observed between patients with or without sarcopenia in terms of intensive care unit or hospital stay ( p = 0.502 and p = 0.378, respectively), and the presence of sarcopenia was not associated with postoperative complications. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the 3-year disease-free survival rate (74.3% vs 66.7%, p = 0.639) or 3-year overall survival rate (83.9% vs 87.7%, p = 0.563) of patients with or without sarcopenia., CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia as determined by preoperative computed tomography does not appear to have a negative impact on surgical outcome or overall survival for resected non-small cell lung cancer patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer cachexia (CC) is commonly seen in advanced lung cancer patients and associated with poor prognosis. However, little is known about CC that develops during chemotherapy. We evaluated the prognostic impact of CC and skeletal muscle wasting that develops during the course of chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients., METHODS: The clinical data of 134 newly diagnosed NSCLC patients were retrospectively reviewed. CC was defined as a body weight loss >5 or >2 % in patients with a body mass index of <20 kg/m(2). CC was assessed at baseline (T1) and 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 12 months (T4) after chemotherapy initiation. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed using the lumber skeletal muscle index (LSMI)., RESULTS: The proportion of patients with CC at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was 45.6, 46.1, 25.5, and 26.0 %, respectively. The frequency of grade 3 chemotherapy-induced anorexia was higher in patients with CC than those without CC at T2 (15.4 vs. 0.0 %, P = 0.0044). At all time points, patients with CC had shorter survival times than those without CC. Patients with low LSMIs (men, <41 cm(2)/m(2); women, <38 cm(2)/m(2)) tended to have poor prognosis. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals for CC at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were 2.53 (1.33-4.88), 1.97 (1.27-3.06), 3.86 (2.14-6.81), and 1.62 (0.80-3.16), respectively., CONCLUSION: CC presence and decreased skeletal muscle mass are associated with poor prognosis in advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate impact of pre-treatment skeletal muscle mass (SMM) on overall survival and non-lung cancer mortality after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: One-hundred and eighty-six patients whose abdominal CT before the treatment was available were enrolled into this study. The patients were divided into two groups of SMM according to gender-specific thresholds for unilateral psoas area. Operability was judged by the treating physician or thoracic surgeon after discussion in a multi-disciplinary tumor board., RESULTS: Patients with low SMM tended to be elderly and underweight in body mass index compared with the high SMM. Overall survival in patients with the low SMM tended to be worse than that in the high SMM (41.1% and 55.9% at 5years, P=0.115). Cumulative incidence of non-lung cancer death was significantly worse in the low SMM (31.3% at 5years compared with 9.7% in the high SMM, P=0.006). Multivariate analysis identified SMM and operability as significant factors for non-lung cancer mortality. Impact of SMM on lung cancer death was not significant. No difference in rate of severe treatment-related toxicity was observed between the SMM groups., CONCLUSION: Low SMM is a significant risk factor for non-lung cancer death, which might lead to worse overall survival, after SBRT for stage I NSCLC. However, the low SMM does not increase lung cancer death or severe treatment-related toxicity. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Skeletal muscle depletion, referred to as sarcopenia, has recently been identified as a risk factor for poor outcomes in various malignancies. However, the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in patients with NSCLC after surgery has not been adequately determined. This study investigated the impact of sarcopenia in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for lung cancer., METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 328 patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC who underwent curative resection between January 2005 and April 2017. Preoperative computed tomography imaging at the third lumbar vertebrae level was assessed to measure the psoas muscle mass index (PMI, cm2/m2). Sarcopenia was defined as a cutoff value of PMI less than 6.36 cm2/m2 for males and 3.92 cm2/m2 for females, based on PMI values from "healthy" subjects., RESULTS: The median patient age was 71 years and 59% were male. Sarcopenia was present in 183 (55.8%) and was significantly related with increasing age (p < 0.001), being male (p < 0.001), smoking habit (p < 0.001), lower body mass index (p < 0.001), and postoperative major complication (Clavien-Dindo grade >=3, p = 0.036). The prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in men than in women, and the prevalence increased with age in men, whereas the prevalence did not increase in females older than 70 years. The 5-year survival rate was 61% in patients with sarcopenia and 91% in those without. Multivariate analysis revealed that sarcopenia was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (p = 0.019)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia as determined using preoperative computed tomography could be used to predict postoperative major complication and prognosis in patients with resected NSCLC. Our results may provide some important information for preoperative management. Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate gefitinib outcomes in EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutations, according to their sarcopenia status., PATIENTS & METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 33 patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 or 21), dividing them into sarcopenic patients, with low skeletal muscle index <=39 cm2/m2 for women and <=55 cm2/m2 for men, and nonsarcopenic patients., RESULTS: Sarcopenia does not affect response to gefitinib treatment in EGFR mutated NSCLC patients, even if it is a bad prognostic indicator for overall survival (p = 0.035)., CONCLUSION: Early recognition of sarcopenia is beneficial for prevention of cancer cachexia and detection of patients at potential risk of serious adverse events. Gefitinib dosage should be reduced and modulated in sarcopenic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the skeletal muscle in the region of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) is generally assessed in order to judge sarcopenia, not every patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoes computed tomography including the L3 region. We hypothesized that immuno-nutritional parameters could predict the existence of sarcopenia in patients with NSCLC., AIM: The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the correlation between preoperative sarcopenia and immuno-nutritional parameters in patients with early-stage NSCLC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 147 of patients with pathological stage I NSCLC who underwent preoperative measurement of immuno-nutritional parameters and CT including the L3 region., RESULTS: Preoperative sarcopenia was significantly associated with female gender (p=0.0003) and poor prognosis (p=0.0322). In Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) by preoperative sarcopenia status, the sarcopenic group had significantly shorter OS than the non-sarcopenic group (5-year OS: 87.27% vs. 77.37%, p=0.0131, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, the preoperative sarcopenia status (hazard ratio=5.138; 95% confidence interval=2.305-11.676; p<0.0001) was an independent prognostic factor. Preoperative sarcopenia status was significantly related to controlling nutritional status score (p=0.0071) and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) (p<0.0001). Spearman's correlation test showed good significant correlation between preoperative sarcopenia status and GNRI (r=0.348, p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: The preoperative GNRI is a simple and useful predictor for existence of preoperative sarcopenia which was associated with poor outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer cachexia and sarcopenia are frequently observed in cancer patients and associated with poor survival. The majority of studies of cancer cachexia and sarcopenia have been done in patients with solid tumors of different origins, and there are currently no good predictors of the benefit of chemotherapy or factors that predict survival in advanced cancer. The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate prevalence of cachexia and sarcopenia using international consensus definition and criteria for diagnosis in patients with diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IIIB and IV and their relation to chemotherapy toxicity and survival prediction. A secondary aim was to compare several biochemical markers (CRP, IL-6, protein, and albumin) with time to tumor progression in order to assess prognostic value or to guide a treatment., METHODS: Between December 2013 and April 2015, the prospective cohort study of 100 Caucasian patients with advanced NSCLC stage IIIB or IV, who were referred consecutively to Department for Respiratory Diseases "Jordanovac," was evaluated. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical data (CRP, albumin, protein, IL-6, haemoglobin) together with body composition measurements (total muscle cross-sectional area, lumbar skeletal muscle index) were obtained for each patient before starting with platinum-doublet therapy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebra was measured by computerized tomography, and sarcopenia was defined using a previously published cutoff point. Toxicity was assessed after cycle 1 of treatment and time-to-tumor progression was determined prospectively., RESULTS: One hundred patients with advanced lung cancer were recruited: 67 were male and median age was 64 years. The median time to disease progression was 187 days. The prevalence of cachexia and sarcopenia in study cohort was 69 and 47 %, respectively. CRP, IL-6, and albumin concentration in cachectic compared to non-cachectic patients demonstrated statistically significant difference (p = 0.020, p = 0.040, p = 0.003). Cachexia and sarcopenia were not found to be predictors of chemotoxicity nor was time to tumor progression. On the contrary, albumin concentration with established cutoff point of 37.5 g/L was clearly proved as the predictive factor of both chemotoxicity (OR (95 % CI) = 0.85; p < 0.001) and survival (HR (95 % CI) = 0.55)., CONCLUSIONS: Albumin level has been shown to be more important predictive marker of chemotherapy toxicity and survival than cachexia and sarcopenia are. This approach in clinical settings can be used to guide the choice of oncologic treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a defining feature of cancer cachexia associated with physical decline, poor quality of life and poor prognosis. Thus, maintaining muscle mass is an important aim of cachexia treatment. Many patients at risk for developing cachexia or with cachexia experience side effects of chemotherapy that might aggravate the development of cachexia. However, achieving tumor control might reverse the catabolic processes causing cachexia. There is limited knowledge about muscle mass changes during chemotherapy or whether changes in muscle mass are associated with response to chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this pilot study, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving three courses of palliative chemotherapy were analyzed. Muscle mass was measured as skeletal muscle cross sectional area (SMCA) at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae using CT images taken before and after chemotherapy., RESULTS: In total 35 patients, 48% women, mean age 67 years (range 56-86), participated; 83% had stage IV disease and 71% were sarcopenic at baseline. Mean reduction in SMCA from pre- to post-chemotherapy was 4.6 cm2 (CI 95% -7.3--1.9; p<0.002), corresponding to a 1.4 kg loss of whole body muscle mass. Sixteen patients remained stable or gained SMCA. Of these, 14 (56%) responded to chemotherapy, while two progressed (p=0.071). Maintaining or gaining SMCA resulted in longer median overall survival (loss: 5.8 months, stable/gain: 10.7 months; p=0.073). Stage of disease (p=0.003), treatment regimen (p=0.023), response to chemotherapy (p=0.007) and SMCA change (p=0.040), but not sarcopenia at baseline, were significant prognostic factors in the multivariate survival analyses., CONCLUSION: Almost half of the patients had stable or increased muscle mass during chemotherapy without receiving any cachexia treatment. Nearly all of these patients responded to the chemotherapy. Increase in muscle mass, but not sarcopenia at baseline, was a significant prognostic factor.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. We aimed to investigate sarcopenia in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent complete resection, and the relationship of sarcopenia with clinicopathological factors., METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent lung resection between January 2005 and December 2008 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Eligible patients were assigned to one of 2 groups according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia, as assessed by the sum of cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscles in the region of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) on preoperative computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: Sixteen of 52 male (30.8%) and 22 of 38 female (57.9%) patients were identified with sarcopenia (p=0.01). Patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have a low body mass index (BMI) (p<0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse outcome than patients without sarcopenia (5-year-survival: 72.8% vs 85.8%, respectively, p=0.028). Multivariate analysis found that sarcopenia was a significant independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio: 7.09, p=0.0008)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia identified on a cross-sectional CT image of the L3 level was associated with poor outcome with completely resected early-stage NSCLC.

AB  - Objectives: Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, and has a risk of adverse outcomes such as disability, poor quality of life and death. As prognosis depends not only on disease aggressiveness, but also on a patient's physical condition, sarcopenia can predict survival in patients with various cancer types. However, its effects on postoperative prognosis in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have never been reported., Methods: We retrospectively investigated 215 male patients with pathological Stage I NSCLC. L3 muscle index is defined as the cross-section area of muscle at the third lumbar vertebra level, normalized for height, and is a clinical measurement of sarcopenia. We then investigated the effect of preoperative sarcopenia on their postoperative prognosis., Results: Our 215 subjects included 30 patients with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with body mass index, nutritional condition, serum CYFRA 21-1 level and pathological stage, but not with preoperative respiratory function or performance status. Frequency of postoperative complications, length of postoperative hospital stay, thoracic drainage period or causes of death were not correlated with the presence of sarcopenia. The sarcopenia group had a significantly shorter median overall survival (32 months) than the no-sarcopenia group., Conclusion: Sarcopenia might not affect short-term outcomes in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Sarcopenia was a predictor of poor prognosis in male patients with Stage I NSCLC. As sarcopenic patients with NSCLC patients are at risk for significantly worse outcomes, their treatments require careful planning, even for those with Stage I disease. Copyright © The Author 2017.
