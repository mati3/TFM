AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical or immunological features in patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), in order to group them and recognize different functional and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) behavior., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Patients meeting Kinder criteria for UCTD were included. We defined the following predictive variables: 'highly specific' connective tissue disease (CTD) manifestations (Raynaud's phenomenon, dry eyes or arthritis), high antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer (above 1: 320), and 'specific' ANA staining patterns (centromere, cytoplasmic and nucleolar patterns). We evaluated the following outcomes: change in the percentage of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) during the follow-up period, and HRCT pattern., RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included. Twenty-nine (43.94%) showed at least one 'highly specific' CTD manifestation, 16 (28.57%) had a 'specific' ANA staining pattern and 29 (43.94%) high ANA titer. Patients with 'highly specific' CTD manifestations were younger (mean [SD] 52 years [14.58] vs 62.08 years [9.46], P<.001), were more likely men (10.34% vs 48.65%, P<.001) and showed a smaller decline of the FVC% (median [interquartile range] 1% [-1 to 10] vs -6% [-16 to -4], P<.006). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of highly specific manifestations was associated with improvement in the FVC% (B coefficient of 13.25 [95% confidence interval, 2.41 to 24.09]). No association was observed in relation to the HRCT pattern., CONCLUSION: The presence of 'highly specific' CTD manifestations was associated with female sex, younger age and better functional behavior. These findings highlight the impact of the clinical features in the outcome of patients with UCTD ILD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the risk of developing a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) after an initial diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF)., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who were evaluated at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from 2009 to 2017. We divided patients with idiopathic ILD into two groups: those who met IPAF criteria and those who did not meet IPAF criteria at initial ILD diagnosis. We examined the association between IPAF and diagnosis of ARD during the follow-up period using a multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model., RESULTS: Of the 697 patients with ILD who were screened, 174 met inclusion criteria (50 met IPAF criteria and 124 did not). During a median follow-up period of 5.2 years, 16% (8/50) of subjects with IPAF were diagnosed with an ARD compared with 1.6% (2/124) of subjects without IPAF (P = 0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, smoking status and use of immunosuppressive therapy, the odds of progressing to an ARD were 14 times higher in subjects with IPAF than in those without IPAF (odds ratio 14.18, 95% CI 1.44-138.95, P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: The presence of IPAF confers an increased risk of developing an ARD. Patients with IPAF should therefore be followed closely for the development of an ARD. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) may overlap with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Little is known about the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and survival of SSc-SLE overlap. We evaluated the prevalence of SSc-SLE overlap and differences in SSc characteristics, and compared survival with SSc without SLE., METHODS: A cohort study was conducted including subjects who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc and/or the ACR criteria for SLE. The primary outcome was time from diagnosis to all-cause mortality. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models., RESULTS: We identified 1252 subjects (SSc: n = 1166, SSc-SLE: n = 86) with an SSc-SLE prevalence of 6.8%. Those with SSc-SLE were younger at diagnosis (37.9 yrs vs 47.9 yrs, p < 0.001), more frequently East Asian (5.5% vs 20%) or South Asian (5.1% vs 12%), had lupus anticoagulant (6% vs 0.3%, p < 0.001), anticardiolipin antibody (6% vs 0.9%, p < 0.001), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; 52% vs 31%, p < 0.001). Those with SSc-SLE less frequently had calcinosis (13% vs 27%, p = 0.007), telangiectasia (49% vs 75%, p < 0.001), and diffuse subtype (12% vs 35%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of renal crisis (7% vs 7%), interstitial lung disease (ILD; 41% vs 34%), and digital ulcers (38% vs 32%). Those with SSc-SLE had better median survival time (26.1 vs 22.4 yrs), but this was not statistically significant (log-rank p = 0.06). Female sex and diffuse subtype attenuated survival differences between groups (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67-1.67)., CONCLUSION: Patients with SSc-SLE are younger at diagnosis, more frequently have PAH, and less frequently have cutaneous manifestations of SSc. They should be monitored for ILD, renal crisis, and digital ulcers.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) complicating connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Progress has been made in our understanding of these collective diseases; however, there are still many unanswered questions. In this review, we describe the current views on epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated ILD. We also highlight several areas that remain unresolved and in need of further investigation, including interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, histopathologic phenotype, and pharmacologic management. A multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach to diagnosis, management, and investigation of CTD-associated ILD patients is essential to advance our understanding of the epidemiology and pathobiology of this challenging group of diseases.

AB  - We held a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) about a 61-year-old woman who had an interstitial lung disease (ILD) without extrathoracic lesions that met the classification criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and the proposed diagnostic criteria for immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related respiratory disease (IgG4-RRD). Clinically, the marked progression of lung-limited diffuse lesions was consistent with IPAF. Serum IgG4 and rheumatoid factor levels simultaneously increased and did not contribute to a diagnosis. Pathologically, the significant hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles was consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated ILD. Pulmonary venous occlusions by intimal fibrosis and intimal thickening were not important because these occlusions are found in IgG4-related lung disease (IgG4-RLD) and also in IPAF or ILDs related to connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Radiologically, fibrosing shadows that remained in the lung periphery after treatment were compatible with RA-associated chronic ILD. We concluded that the present case was IPAF that met the proposed diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RRD. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may occur in patients with a rheumatic autoimmune disease (AD), increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the prevalence of AD in patients diagnosed with an ILD. In this prospective study, we determined the spectrum of ILD associated with AD (AD-ILD) among patients sent for assessment to a single clinic of ILD and lung transplantation from a referral center between May 2016 and December 2019. ILD diagnosis was made by pneumologists based on clinical and radiological findings and pulmonary function test abnormalities. All patients with ILD were also assessed by experienced rheumatologists. During the period of assessment, 338 patients were diagnosed with ILD. Among them, 32.8% fulfilled definitions for an AD. Most cases with AD-ILD had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (27.0%), systemic sclerosis (26.1%) or anti-synthetase syndrome (17.1%). Interestingly, 18% of the patients with AD-ILD were diagnosed as having an interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Antinuclear antibodies and non-specific interstitial pneumonia were the most frequent positive autoantibodies and radiological pattern found in AD-ILD patients, respectively. In conclusion, our study indicates that a high number of ILD patients have a related AD. Consequently, close collaboration among rheumatologists and pneumologists is needed.

AB  - Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) without a definitive diagnosis of connective tissue diseases (CTD) were historically described as Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD-ILD). Recently a new classification, Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF), has been proposed. Aim of this study was to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of UCTD and IPAF subjects in a cohort of Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP) patients. This retrospective, observational study enrolled 102 adult patients characterized by NSIP pattern on High Resolution Computed Tomography, without a specific diagnosis of CTD. Three groups were identified according to patients' characteristics: IPAF, UCTD or idiopathic NSIP (iNSIP). Forty percent, 27% and 55% of patients showed diagnostic criteria for IPAF, UCTD and iNSIP, respectively. No significant differences in age, gender, smoking habit, pulmonary function tests and three-year survival rate were observed among study groups. IPAF patients with antisynthetase antibodies positivity, in comparison to IPAF without antisynthetase antibodies positivity, showed more frequently an acute onset (44% vs 9%, p<0.012). The presence of autoimmune features seems not to be associated with better outcomes in NSIP patients. IPAF criteria seem to be more representative than UCTD criteria in identifying patients with autoimmune features. Further studies are needed to verify if IPAF should include patients with positive antisynthetase serology.

AB  - Regulator of telomere length 1 (RTEL1) mutations have been evidenced in 5-9% of familial pulmonary fibrosis; however, the phenotype of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and RTEL1 mutations is poorly understood.Whole exome sequencing was performed in 252 probands with ILD and we included all patients with ILD and RTEL1 mutation. RTEL1 expression was evaluated by immunochemistry in the lungs of controls, as well as in RTEL1 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutation carriers. We identified 35 subjects from 17 families. Median age at diagnosis of ILD was 53.1 years (range 28.0-80.6). The most frequent pulmonary diagnoses were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n=20, 57%), secondary ILD (n=7, 20%) and unclassifiable fibrosis or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (n=7, 20%). The median transplant-free and overall survival periods were 39.2 months and 45.3 months, respectively. Forced vital capacity at diagnosis was the only factor associated with decreased transplant-free survival. Extra-pulmonary manifestations were less frequent as compared to other telomere-related gene mutation carriers. A systematic analysis of the literature identified 110 patients with ILD and RTEL1 mutations (including this series) and confirmed the heterogeneity of the pulmonary phenotype, the prevalence of non-idiopathic diseases and the low prevalence of extra-pulmonary manifestations.Immunohistochemistry showed that RTEL1 was expressed by bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as by alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes, but not by fibroblasts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotypic characteristics and natural history of patients with autoimmune forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD)., METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive, single-center study of patients with autoimmune forms of ILD evaluated between February 2008 and August 2014. All data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Longitudinal changes in forced vital capacity (FVC%) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco%) in percent predicted were analyzed and time-to-event analyses for death were performed using Cox regression., RESULTS: Of the entire cohort (n = 243), systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated ILD (n = 88, 36%), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF, n = 56, 23%), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated ILD (n = 42, 17%), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)-associated ILD (n = 26, 11%) were the most common phenotypes. The SSc-ILD, IIM-ILD, and IPAF groups had similar features: average age in the mid-50s, strongly female predominant and more likely to have nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). In contrast, RA-ILD patients were older, gender balanced, more likely to be past smokers and were UIP predominant. Adjusted longitudinal lung function was stable during a median follow-up period of nearly 4 years and the independent predictors for death were older age (p = 0.003), male sex (p = 0.019), and lower FVC (p = < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The predominant phenotypes of autoimmune ILD were SSc-ILD, IPAF, RA-ILD, and IIM-ILD. In contrast to the other subsets, those with RA-ILD may be older, gender balanced, with more smoking history, and higher proportion of UIP. Longitudinal lung function was stable among the groups and younger age, female gender, and better lung function were associated with improved survival.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical phenotype and natural history of a cohort of patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF)., METHODS: A retrospective, single center study of 56 patients with IPAF evaluated between February 2008 and August 2014. All clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record and longitudinal changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) were analyzed with mixed-effects, piecewise linear regression models that considered time as a continuous factor., RESULTS: All patients fulfilled classification criteria for IPAF. The majority were women (71%) and never smokers (68%). The most frequently identified clinical features were Raynaud's phenomenon (39%), distal digital fissuring (29%), Gottron's sign (18%) and inflammatory arthropathy (16%). The most frequently identified serologies were antinuclear antibody (ANA) (48%), anti-Ro (SSA) (43%) and anti-tRNA-synthetase antibodies (36%). Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (57.1%) followed by NSIP with organizing pneumonia (18%) were the most common radiologic patterns, while usual interstitial pneumonia was identified in only 9%. All but one patient was treated with immunosuppression: prednisone (82%) and mycophenolate mofetil (76%) were the most frequently used agents. During a follow-up period of 284.9 +/- 141.3 days, modeled longitudinal FVC% was stable (slope = 0.69/year) and no deaths were observed in the cohort., CONCLUSIONS: In this single center study, patients with IPAF were predominately non-smoking women with high-resolution computed tomography scans that suggested NSIP. Their pulmonary physiology was stable, and during limited follow-up, no deaths were observed. Prospective and multi-center studies are needed to better inform our understanding of IPAF.

AB  - In 2015, a multidisciplinary task force comprising pulmonologists, rheumatologists, pathologists, and radiologists representing the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society published a diagnostic classification schema for individuals with interstitial lung disease and autoimmune features who did not meet criteria for a defined connective tissue disease. The term interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was applied. Classification criteria are often nonspecific, but up to 90% of subjects with IPAF have serological evidence for autoimmunity (particularly (+) antinuclear antibodies). Distinguishing patients with IPAF from idiopathic pulmonary disorders may be difficult. The natural history and appropriate management of IPAF have not been clarified, as data are largely limited to retrospective studies. In this review, we discuss the salient clinical, serologic, histologic, and radiographic features of IPAF and discuss an approach to management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic significance of CT patterns that cannot be classified according to current idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) guidelines and of specific findings of the inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of interstitial lung disease who had undergone surgical lung biopsy and chest CT within 1 year of each other were included in the study. The predominant distribution and pattern of disease were scored. Cases were classified as UIP, possible UIP, or inconsistent with UIP at chest CT according to 2011 IPF guidelines. Cases that could not be confidently categorized with current guidelines were annotated as indeterminate., RESULTS: UIP, possible UIP, and inconsistent with UIP CT patterns were associated with pathologic UIP in 89.6%, 81.6%, and 60.0% of subjects. An indeterminate CT pattern (7.7% [20/259]) was associated with a UIP pathologic diagnosis in 55.0% of cases. This finding was not statistically different from the findings in the group with the inconsistent with UIP CT pattern (p = 0.677) but was different from the findings in the UIP (p < 0.001) and possible UIP (p = 0.031) groups. In regard to specific findings of the inconsistent with UIP CT category, ground-glass opacity, air-trapping, consolidation, and axial distribution were associated with a non-UIP pathologic diagnosis; however, there was no significant association with zonal distribution., CONCLUSION: A substantial minority of cases cannot be confidently categorized according to current guidelines for IPF and differ diagnostically from the possible UIP and UIP CT categories. The term "inconsistent with UIP" is misleading and should be renamed.

AB  - Introduction: Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs) are systemic autoimmune conditions characterized by frequent lung involvement. This usually takes the form of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), but Obstructive Lung Disease (OLD) and Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH) can also occur. Lung involvement is often severe, representing the first cause of death in CTD. The aim of this study is to highlight the role of Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) in the diagnosis and follow up of CTD patients., Main body: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) showed mainly an ILD with a Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern in High-Resolution Chest Tomography (HRCT). PFTs are able to highlight a RA-ILD before its clinical onset and to drive follow up of patients with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO). In the course of Scleroderma Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) and Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs), DLCO appears to be more sensitive than FVC in highlighting an ILD, but it can be compromised by the presence of PAH. A restrictive respiratory pattern can be present in IIMs and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus due to the inflammatory involvement of respiratory muscles, the presence of fatigue or diaphragm distress., Conclusions: The lung should be carefully studied during CTDs. PFTs can represent an important prognostic tool for diagnosis and follow up of RA-ILD, but, on their own, lack sufficient specificity or sensitivity to describe lung involvement in SSDs and IIMs. Several composite indexes potentially able to describe the evolution of lung damage and response to treatment in SSDs are under investigation. Considering the potential severity of these conditions, an HRCT jointly with PFTs should be performed in all new diagnoses of SSDs and IIMs. Moreover, follow up PFTs should be interpreted in the light of the risk factor for respiratory disease related to each disease.

AB  - A systematic approach is recommended to search for clinical and biological features of connective tissue disease (CTD) in any patient with interstitial lung disease (ILD). In the diagnostic approach to ILD, a diagnosis of CTD should be considered particularly in women and subjects younger than 50 years, and in those with an imaging and/or pathological pattern of non-specific interstitial pneumonia. However, the diagnosis of CTD may be difficult when ILD is the presenting or the dominant manifestation of CTD. A proportion of patients with ILD present symptoms that belong to the spectrum of CTD and/or biological autoimmune features, but do not fulfil diagnostic criteria for a given CTD. Some imaging and histopathological patterns may also suggest the presence of an underlying CTD. Although studies published to date used heterogeneous definitions and terminology for this condition, evidence is accumulating that even limited CTD features are relevant regarding symptoms, imaging features, pathological pattern and possibly evolution to overt CTD, whereas the impact on prognosis needs confirmation. Conversely, autoantibodies alone do not seem to impact the prognosis or management in patients with otherwise typical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and no extra-pulmonary manifestation. A collective international multidisciplinary effort has proposed a uniform definition and criteria for 'interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features', a condition characterized by limited CTD features occurring in the setting of ILD, with the aim of fostering future clinical studies. Referral of ILD patients suspect to have CTD to a rheumatologist and possibly multidisciplinary discussion may contribute to a better management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and the correlation between them., METHODS: We respectively analyzed the patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted in our hospital from January 2014 to January 2017. The patients who met all priori requirements and at least one feature of one domain were recuited, and the clinical features and autoimmune diseases related prognosis were analyzed., RESULTS: There were 90 patients recruited,including 38 patients completely met IPAF classification criteria and 52 patients who incompletely met. The average age was (62.34+/-14.98) yr.. The pneumonia pattern of complete IPAF patients was non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), while it was usually interstitial pneumonia (UIP) in the incomplete IPAF patients. During follow-up,11 patients were diagnosed with autoimmune diseases (4 with complete IPAF,and 7 with incomplete IPAF) . According to Cox regression analysis,completely meet the criteria of IPAF was related to the relapse of disease., CONCLUSION: There exist relation between IPAF and autoimmune diseases. The patients with IPAFmay finally develop into autoimmune diseases. The IPAF classification criteria provide basic structure for this disease,but the limitation of the criteria call for revising by more clinical trials.

AB  - Imaging, specifically computed tomography (CT), is a key component in the characterization, management, and follow-up of patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)-related diffuse lung disease. The main role of CT is to help direct treatment by determining the primary pattern of lung injury present. Other roles include follow-up of lung disease over time, evaluation of acute symptoms, and monitoring for treatment complications. Although diagnosis is typically made using clinical and serologic criteria, CT plays an important role when lung disease is the dominant presenting feature. This article delineates the roles of CT in patients with CTD-related lung disease. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A significant proportion of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) manifest autoimmune features, but do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for a definite connective tissue disease (CTD). In 2015, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) "Task Force on undifferentiated Forms of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease" proposed classification criteria for a so-called research category of Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF). These classification criteria were based on a combination of features from three domains: a clinical domain consisting of extra-thoracic features; a serologic domain with specific autoantibodies; and a morphologic domain with imaging patterns, histopathological findings or multi-compartment involvement. Patients meeting IPAF criteria tend to have a history of smoking similar to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The most frequent clinical and serological markers of autoimmune features are Raynaud' phenomenon and positive antinuclear antibodies, respectively. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia is the predominant radiologic and histopathologic pattern, although patients meeting IPAF criteria through the clinical and serologic domains may also have a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. Management should be carefully individualized on a case-by-case basis in keeping with the wide heterogeneity of IPAF and lack of evidence in this particular subgroup of patients. Prognosis is generally intermediate between that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease, but substantially variable according to the predominant histologic and radiologic patterns. As acknowledged by the Task Force, the proposed classification scheme of IPAF is a research concept that will need revision and refinement based on data to better inform prognostication and patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lungs, varying from idiopathic interstitial pneumonias to secondary variants, including the ILDs associated to connective tissue diseases (CTDs). In addition, a number of patients are recognized as unclassifiable ILD (U-ILD), because of the inability to reach a definite diagnosis; some of them show autoimmune manifestations not fulfilling the classification criteria of a given CTD. The term interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has been recently proposed for this particular ILD subset., METHODS: Here, we report our experience resulting from the integrated - pneumology/rheumatology - approach to patients with suspected ILDs or CTDs referred to our university-based Center for the Rare Pulmonary Diseases and Rheumatology Unit, from January 2009 to June 2015, with particular attention to the above-mentioned U-ILD, IPAF, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). The comparative analysis of these clinical variants was carried out; moreover, the observed findings were compared with the results of the updated review of the literature., RESULTS: After the first clinical assessment, the U-ILD were identified in 50 patients; afterwards, on the basis of clinico-serological and radiological findings U-ILD group was subdivided into 2 subgroups, namely U-ILD without any clinical extra-thoracic manifestations and/or immunological alterations (15 pts) and IPAF according to the above-mentioned classification criteria (35 pts). Patients with either IPAF or U-ILD were compared with a series of 52 stable UCTD (disease duration >=3 years), followed at our Rheumatology Unit. Some important differences were evidenced among the 3 series of U-ILD, IPAF, and UCTD: firstly, female gender was more frequent in patients with UCTD (86%) or IPAF (69%) compared with U-ILD (60%) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (24%; p=0.001). In addition, UCTD patients were younger and showed longer disease duration. More interestingly, both UCTD and IPAF series show a comparable prevalence of various clinical manifestations, with the exception of the interstitial lung involvement detectable in a very small percentage of UCTD patients. Concordantly, the review of the literature evidenced two main subsets of U-ILD, one is characterized by isolated unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia and another one composed by subjects with clinically prevalent lung involvement in the setting of not definite CTD, the recently proposed IPAF., CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that IPAF and UCTD might represent two clinical variants of the same systemic autoimmune disorders. The marked difference regarding the prevalence of ILD, which is the clinical hallmark of IPAF but very rare in UCTD, may at least in part reflect a selection bias of patients generally referred to different specialist centers, i.e. pneumology or rheumatology, according to the presence/absence of clinically dominant ILD, respectively. Well-integrated, interdisciplinary teams are recommended for the assessment and management of these patients in the clinical practice. Finally, the cooperation between multidisciplinary groups with different experiences may be advisable for a validation study of the proposed nomenclature and classification criteria of these indefinable ILD/CTD variants.

AB  - Many patients with an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) have clinical features that suggest an underlying autoimmune process but do not meet established criteria for a connective tissue disease (CTD). Researchers have proposed differing criteria and terms to describe these patients, and lack of consensus over nomenclature and classification limits the ability to conduct prospective studies of a uniform cohort. The "European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society Task Force on Undifferentiated Forms of Connective Tissue Disease-associated Interstitial Lung Disease" was formed to create consensus regarding the nomenclature and classification criteria for patients with IIP and features of autoimmunity. The task force proposes the term "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF) and offers classification criteria organised around the presence of a combination of features from three domains: a clinical domain consisting of specific extra-thoracic features, a serologic domain consisting of specific autoantibodies, and a morphologic domain consisting of specific chest imaging, histopathologic or pulmonary physiologic features.A designation of IPAF should be used to identify individuals with IIP and features suggestive of, but not definitive for, a CTD. With IPAF, a sound platform has been provided from which to launch the requisite future research investigations of a more uniform cohort. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

AB  - The opportunity of a multidisciplinary evaluation for the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonias highlighted a major change in the diagnostic approach to diffuse lung disease. The new American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Society guidelines for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have reinforced this assumption and have underlined that the exclusion of connective tissue disease related lung involvement is mandatory, with obvious clinical and therapeutic impact. The multidisciplinary team discussion consists in a moment of interaction among the radiologist, pathologist and pulmonologist, also including the rheumatologist when considered necessary, to improve diagnostic agreement and optimize the definition of those cases in which pulmonary involvement may represent the first or prominent manifestation of an autoimmune systemic disease. Moreover, the proposal of classification criteria for interstitial lung disease with autoimmune features (IPAF) represents an effort to define lung involvement in clinically undefined autoimmune conditions. The complexity of autoimmune diseases, and in particular the lack of classification criteria defined for pathologies such as anti-synthetase syndrome, makes the involvement of the rheumatologist essential for the correct interpretation of the autoimmune element and for the application of classification criteria, that could replace clinical pictures initially interpreted as IPAF in defined autoimmune disease, minimizing the risk of misdiagnosis. The aim of this review was to evaluate the available evidence about the efficiency and efficacy of different multidisciplinary team approaches, in order to standardize the professional figures and the core set procedures that should be necessary for a correct approach in diagnosing patients with interstitial lung disease.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical features and prognosis of interstitial lung disease patients with positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Methods: The patients with interstitial lung disease who visited Peking Union Medical College Hospital from March 2006 to March 2016 were divided into three groups: interstitial lung disease with ANCA-positive(ANCA-ILD), connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung disease and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (CTD-ILD/IPAF) and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). The three groups were analyzed in terms of clinical manifestations, serology, lung function, imaging, survival and recurrence. Results: Two hundred and seventy four patients were enrolled and 38 (14%) were ANCA-positive of whom 16 were male and 22 were female. The age of 38 ANCA-positive patients was (59+/-10) years and the follow-up time was (52+/-31) months. Seven among the 38 ANCA-positive patients died and the death rate is 18.42%. The ANCA-positive patients with interstitial lung disease have higher onset age (ANCA-ILD:59+/-10,CTD-ILD/IPAF:52+/-10,IIP:53+/-11,H=19.29, P<0.001), lower hemoglobin (ANCA-ILD: 129+/-21, CTD-ILD/IPAF: 138+/-15, IIP: 140+/-19, H=8.17, P=0.017), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ANCA-ILD:45+/-35, CTD-ILD/IPAF:26+/-24,IIP:19+/-22,H=19.73, P<0.001), lower lung function improvement rate after treatment (ANCA-ILD:31%,CTD-ILD/IPAF:59%,IIP: 39%,chi(2)=11.74,P=0.003), lower absorption rate of CT lesion (ANCA-ILD:61%,CTD-ILD/IPAF:82%,IIP:67%, chi(2)=9.23,P=0.010) and higher death rate(ANCA-ILD:18%,CTD-ILD/IPAF:6%,IIP:12%, chi(2)=7.16,P=0.028). Conclusions: There are significant differences in clinical characteristics between ANCA-positive patients and other types of pulmonary interstitial disease. And both the treatment effect and the prognosis is poor for the ANCA-positive patients.

AB  - RATIONALE: The concept of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was recently proposed by the American Thoracic Society. However, the clinical significance of the serologic domain of IPAF has not yet been established in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of autoantibody positivity in IPF., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 512 patients diagnosed as IPF from January 2007 through March 2014. The patients were divided into two subgroups: (i) an autoantibody-positive IPF subgroup (n=138), consisting of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or autoantibodies that met the criteria for the IPAF serologic domain; (ii) a lone IPF subgroup (n=374), consisting of the rest of the IPF patients., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Autoantibody-positivity (HR 0.736, p=0.043) was an independent risk factors for 5-year mortality on multivariable analysis in the overall IPF patients. In the autoantibody-positive IPF patients, use of glucocorticoid (not for management of acute exacerbation, HR 2.121, p=0.019), use of immunomodulators (HR 0.310, p=0.002), malignancy (HR 3.359, p=0.002), baseline forced vital capacity (HR 0.974, p=0.017), baseline diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (HR 0.981, p=0.041), and baseline 6-min walk test distance (HR 0.996, p=0.002) were independent risk factors for 5-year mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Presence of ANCA or autoantibodies of the IPAF serologic domain in IPF patients is associated with better survival outcomes, and the use of immunomodulators is associated with superior survival outcomes.

AB  - Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) characterises individuals with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and features of connective tissue disease (CTD) who fail to satisfy CTD criteria. Inclusion of myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) in the IPAF criteria has generated controversy, as these patients also meet proposed criteria for an anti-synthetase syndrome. Whether MSAs and myositis associated antibodies (MAA) identify phenotypically distinct IPAF subgroups remains unclear.A multi-center, retrospective investigation was conducted to assess clinical features and outcomes in patients meeting IPAF criteria stratified by the presence of MSAs and MAAs. IPAF subgroups were compared to cohorts of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-ILD (IIM-ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IIM CTD-ILDs. The primary endpoint assessed was three-year transplant-free survival. Two hundred sixty-nine patients met IPAF criteria, including 35 (13%) with MSAs and 65 (24.2%) with MAAs. Survival was highest among patients with IPAF-MSA and closely approximated those with IIM-ILD. Survival did not differ between IPAF-MAA and IPAF without MSA/MAA cohorts. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) morphology was associated with differential outcome risk, with IPAF patients with non-UIP morphology approximating survival observed in non-IIM CTD-ILDs. MSAs, but not MAAs identified a unique IPAF phenotype characterised by clinical features and outcomes similar to IIM-ILD. UIP morphology was a strong predictor of outcome in others meeting IPAF criteria. Because IPAF is a research classification without clear treatment approach, these findings suggest MSAs should be removed from the IPAF criteria and such patients should be managed as an IIM-ILD.

AB  - Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a research classification proposed by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society Task Force on Undifferentiated Forms of Connective Tissue Disease-associated Interstitial Lung Disease as an initial step to uniformly define, identify, and study patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have features of autoimmunity, yet fall short of a characterizable connective tissue disease. Since its publication in July 2015, there has been substantial interest in IPAF. Centers from around the world have published their findings of retrospectively identified cohorts of patients who fulfill IPAF criteria, suggestions for modification of the criteria have been offered, and patients who fulfill IPAF criteria are being included as a subset in the ongoing phase II multicenter unclassifiable ILD treatment trial with pirfenidone. The IPAF designation represents an important first step toward studying and furthering our understanding of the natural history of this cohort of patients with ILD using uniform nomenclature and a standardized set of criteria. Prospective evaluations and, ideally, interdisciplinary and multicenter collaborations will inform best practices for treatment and management and will guide future refinement to the IPAF criteria. This review focuses on the relevant background that led to the development of IPAF, summarizes the proposed criteria, discusses cohort studies of patients with IPAF published to date and what they have taught us about the IPAF phenotype, and offers insights into future directions in this arena. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03099187).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) identifies a recently recognized autoimmune syndrome characterized by interstitial lung disease and autoantibodies positivity, but absence of a specific connective tissue disease diagnosis or alternative etiology. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup and management of seven critically ill patients who met diagnostic criteria for IPAF. We compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of IPAF patients with those of the population of ARDS patients admitted in the same period., RESULTS: Seven consecutive patients with IPAF admitted to intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were compared with 78 patients with ARDS secondary to a known risk factor and with eight ARDS patients without recognized risk factors. Five IPAF patients (71%) survived and were discharged alive from ICU: Their survival rate was equal to that of patients with a known risk factor (71%), while the subgroup of patients without risk factors had a markedly lower survival (38%). According to the Berlin definition criteria, ARDS was severe in four IPAF patients and moderate in the remaining three. All had multiple organ dysfunction at presentation. The most frequent autoantibody detected was anti-SSA/Ro52. All patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation (median duration 49 days, range 10-88); four received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and one received low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal. All patients received immunosuppressive therapy., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a cohort of critical patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for IPAF presenting with ARDS. This diagnosis should be considered in any critically ill patient with interstitial lung disease of unknown origin. While management is challenging and level of support high, survival appears to be good and comparable to that of patients with ARDS associated with a known clinical insult.

AB  - To date, there is no clear agreement regarding which is the best method to detect a connective tissue disease (CTD) during the initial diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILD). The aim of our study was to explore the impact of a systematic diagnostic strategy to detect CTD-associated ILD (CTD-ILD) in clinical practice, and to clarify the significance of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) diagnosis in ILD patients.Consecutive patients evaluated in an ILD Diagnostic Program were divided in 3 groups: IPAF, CTD-ILD, and other ILD forms. Clinical characteristics, exhaustive serologic testing, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images, lung biopsy specimens, and follow-up were prospectively collected and analyzed.Among 139 patients with ILD, CTD was present in 21 (15.1%), 24 (17.3%) fulfilled IPAF criteria, and 94 (67.6%) were classified as other ILD forms. Specific systemic autoimmune symptoms such as Raynaud phenomenon (19%), inflammatory arthropathy (66.7%), and skin manifestations (38.1%) were more frequent in CTD-ILD patients than in the other groups (all P < .001). Among autoantibodies, antinuclear antibody was the most frequently found in IPAF (42%), and CTD-ILD (40%) (P = .04). Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, detected by HRCT scan, was the most frequently seen pattern in patients with IPAF (63.5%), or CTD-ILD (57.1%) (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, a suggestive radiological pattern by HRCT scan (odds ratio [OR] 15.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-48.3, P < .001) was the strongest independent predictor of CTD-ILD or IPAF, followed by the presence of clinical features (OR 14.6, 95% CI 4.3-49.5, P < .001), and serological features (OR 12.4, 95% CI 3.5-44.0, P < .001). This systematic diagnostic strategy was useful in discriminating an underlying CTD in patients with ILD. The defined criteria for IPAF are fulfilled by a considerable proportion of patients referred for ILD.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of pirfenidone in fibrotic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) after treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2 adult patients with IPAF in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. As their fibrotic interstitial lung disease failed to improve with further treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, they were treated with pirfenidone based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Their clinical, chest radiological data and prognosis were collected and relevant literatures were reviewed. Results: One patient was a 43 year old female, the other was a 53 year old male. IPAF was diagnosed with their classic clinical, serological and radiological features. They were partially responded to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants at the initial period. Pirfenidone was suggested for them as their lung fibrosis was not improved further with immunosuppressive therapy. After 4-5 months treatment with pirfenidone, based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressant administration, their clinical and radiological manifestations improved significantly. Conclusions: Pirfenidone might be a good add-on choice for fibrotic IPAF when the disease did not respond well to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients positive for anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies, and to analyse the potential pathogenesis of anti-MDA5 antibodies., METHODS: The clinical manifestations, serological tests, imaging features, treatments, and prognoses of 32 anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients diagnosed in the Rheumatology and Immunology Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from September 2015 to August 2018 were analysed., RESULTS: Of the 32 anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients, eleven patients were clinically diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), ten patients were diagnosed with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), six patients were diagnosed with dermatomyositis (DM) and five patients were diagnosed with anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). Thirty patients had various degrees of pulmonary interstitial changes. The incidence of mortality, subcutaneous emphysema, hoarseness and dysphagia in patients who were positive for both anti-MDA5 and anti-Ro52 antibodies was significantly higher than in patients positive for only anti-MDA5 antibodies. The anti-MDA5 antibody-positive IPAF patients had a very poor prognosis, and mortality in these patients was as high as 54.55%., CONCLUSIONS: Anti-MDA5 antibodies are closely related to interstitial lung disease (ILD). The presence of both anti-MDA5 and anti-Ro52 antibodies indicates poor prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The study aimed to illustrate the cardiopulmonary findings of the following collagen vascular diseases on cross-sectional imaging: rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, the inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis/dermatomyositis), and Sjogren's syndrome., RECENT FINDINGS: Although collagen vascular diseases can affect any part of the body, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension are the two most important cardiopulmonary complications and are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a newly described entity that encompasses interstitial lung disease in patients with clinical, serologic, or morphologic features suggestive of but not diagnostic of collagen vascular disease; these patients are thought to have better outcomes than idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension determine the prognosis in collagen vascular disease patients. IPAF is a new term to label patients with possible collagen vascular disease-related interstitial lung disease. Collagen vascular disease patients are at increased risk for various malignancies.

AB  - The diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) requires meticulous evaluation for an underlying connective tissue disease (CTD), with major implications for prognosis and management. CTD associated ILD (CTD-ILD) occurs most commonly in the context of an established CTD, but can be the first and/or only manifestation of an occult CTD or occur in patients who have features suggestive of an autoimmune process, but not meeting diagnostic criteria for a defined CTD-recently defined as "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF). The detection of specific autoantibodies serves a critical role in the diagnosis of CTD-ILD, but there remains a lack of data to guide clinical practice including which autoantibodies should be tested on initial assessment and when or in whom serial testing should be performed. The implications of detecting autoantibodies in patients with IPAF on disease behaviour and management remain unknown. The evaluation of CTD-ILD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of presentations and types of CTD and ILD that may be encountered, and thus it is imperative that immunologic tests are interpreted in conjunction with a detailed rheumatologic history and examination and multidisciplinary collaboration between respiratory physicians, rheumatologists, immunologists, radiologists and pathologists.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the prognosis and prognostic factors of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) in comparison to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial pneumonia (CTD-IP)., DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis., DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases such as Medline and Embase were searched from 2015 through 6 September 2019., ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Primary studies that comparatively investigated the prognosis or prognostic factors of IPAF were eligible., DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of bias independently. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The quality of presented evidence was assessed by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system., RESULTS: Out of a total of 656 records retrieved, 12 studies were reviewed. The clinical features of IPAF were diverse between studies, which included a radiological and/or pathological usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern of between 0% and 73.8%. All studies contained some risk of bias. There was no significant difference of all-cause mortality between IPAF-UIP and IPF in all studies, although the prognosis of IPAF in contrast to IPF or CTD-IP varied between studies depending on the proportion of UIP pattern. Among the potential prognostic factors identified, age was significantly associated with all-cause mortality of IPAF by a pooled analysis of univariate results with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.07). The adjusted effect of age was also significant in all studies. The quality of presented evidence was deemed as very low., CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference of all-cause mortality between IPAF-UIP and IPF. Age was deemed as a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality of IPAF. The findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the low quality of the presented evidence., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018115870. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical features of patients who developed collagen vascular disease (CVD) after an initial diagnosis of idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 72 consecutive patients with NSIP who were diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy in our institution (idiopathic NSIP, n = 35; CVD-NSIP, n = 37 at initial diagnosis). No patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for a diagnosis with CVD within six months after the diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP., RESULTS: Of 35 patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic NSIP, six patients (17.1%) developed CVD during the follow-up period (5.5 +/- 5.0 years); three patients were diagnosed with dermatomyositis (DM), two patients with overlap syndrome (DM and Sjogren's syndrome), and one patient with rheumatoid arthritis. The mean time until CVD diagnosis was 2.0 years (six months - 3.5 years), and the one-, two- and three-year incidences of CVD development were 3.6%, 15.2% and 20.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics and survival among patients with NSIP preceding CVD diagnosis, those with idiopathic NSIP, or those with CVD-NSIP. In addition, at the time of initial diagnosis, there was no significant difference for the fulfillment of previous criteria such as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune feature (IPAF) between patients with NSIP preceding CVD diagnosis and those with idiopathic NSIP., CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to predict CVD occurrence and careful attention is needed to detect the development of CVD in patients with idiopathic NSIP.

AB  - A 65-year-old Japanese male with type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital with a productive cough and worsening dyspnea. He had started receiving vildagliptin, which is one of the dipeptideylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, several days before the appearance of his symptoms. Laboratory findings revealed markedly elevated levels of immunoglobulin E and Krebs von den Lungen-6. Chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass opacity with irregular reticulation throughout both lungs. Biopsy specimens by transbronchial lung biopsy showed subacute interstitial pneumonia and an organizing pneumonia pattern with acute alveolar injury. The drug lymphocyte stimulation test showed a positive result for vildagliptin. Withdrawal of vildagliptin and administration of glucocorticoid treatment improved his respiratory condition and radiological findings. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with vildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia based on both his clinical course and pathological findings. Interstitial pneumonia as a side effect of vildagliptin is rare. It may be necessary to monitor the respiratory condition of patients upon administration of DPP-4 inhibitors until further evidence is obtained.

AB  - Objective Chest physicians often encounter patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. However, there have so far been few reports of patients presenting with concurrent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and interstitial pneumonia. The prevalence of interstitial pneumonia in patients with ITP is less well known. Methods We surveyed patients diagnosed with ITP and interstitial pneumonia at the departments of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine to evaluate the association between these diseases. Results Among 73 patients with ITP, 7 patients (9.6%) presented with interstitial pneumonia, including 4 patients (2%) who developed ITP in the course of 204 patients with interstitial pneumonia. All 7 patients were men. Four patients were positive for some autoantibodies. Two patients had autoimmune diseases other than ITP. There were significant differences in age and gender between the ITP patients with and without interstitial pneumonia. Conclusion The present study suggests the possibility that the development of ITP, other autoimmune diseases, and interstitial pneumonia may be mutually associated. Advanced age and male sex in ITP may be significant predisposing factors for interstitial pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for the coexistence of these diseases.

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is essential for optimal prognostication and management. While connective tissue disease (CTD) is among the most common causes of ILD, some patients have features suggestive of autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a specific CTD. To help define and study this disease entity more uniformly, a 2015 research statement proposed consensus-based criteria and coined the term "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF). In this review, we summarize and compare previously proposed criteria to characterize these patients, provide an overview of the IPAF criteria and highlight recent investigations aimed at characterizing IPAF cohorts. We then call attention to questions that have arisen with the application of the IPAF criteria and discuss future areas of study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common feature of mixed connective tissue disease. However, many patients do not meet the criteria for mixed connective tissue disease and thus may be diagnosed as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. The aim of this study was to characterize ILD associated with anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies., METHODS: Chest computed tomography scans of patients with anti-RNP antibody who were seen between January 2011 and October 2015 were reviewed. The underlying disease was classified with international criteria using clinical and serological features., RESULTS: Among 544 patients with anti-RNP antibodies, 188 had a chest computed tomography scan, and 48 (26%) of them had radiological features of ILD. The presence of ILD was significantly associated with dyspnea, crackles, arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, myositis, and sicca syndrome. The most frequent pattern was nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in 39 patients (81%). Among patients with ILD, 17 (35%) had a radiological pattern consisting of cysts and ground-glass attenuation not fulfilling the lymphoid interstitial pneumonia criteria. In 3 patients, cysts were related to fibrosis; in 14 patients, cysts corresponded to an original ILD pattern., CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial lung disease was found in 26% of patients with anti-RNP antibodies independently of the underlying disease. Anti-RNP-associated ILD mainly corresponds to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or an original pattern consisting of cysts and ground-glass attenuation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical characteristics of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and connective tissue disease interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) have not been adequately compared. We compared the clinical characteristics of these two conditions and analyzed the changes in lung function before and after treatment of IPAF., METHODS: A total of 412 patients were enrolled in the study, and their clinical characteristics were assessed. The treatment-related changes in 12 cases of IPAF were analyzed., RESULTS: Complete clinical data were available for 126 patients with CTD-ILD and 147 with IPAF. All IPAF patients showed autoantibody positivity. The proportion of patients showing extrapulmonary symptoms in the CTD-ILD group was higher than that in the IPAF group (P < 0.05). Patients with IPAF demonstrated lower P(A-a)O2 and higher PaO2 and PaCO2 than those with CTD-ILD (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in IPAF patients were higher than those in CTD-ILD patients (P = 0.023 for FVC; P = 0.011 for DLCO). Among patients with IPAF, only the proportions of honeycombing and nodules were lower than those in CTD-ILD patients (P < 0.05). Both FVC and DLCO values increased after treatment in patients with IPAF (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: IPAF showed autoantibody positivity and similar computed tomography (CT) findings as CTD-ILD, and lung function in patients with IPAF improved after immunosuppressive treatment, indicating that IPAF should receive attention and early immunosuppressive treatment like CTD-ILD, even though IPAF exhibits no extrapulmonary symptoms.Key Points* Clinical characteristics of IPAF.

AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) for the etiologic evaluation of diffuse lung disease (DLD). Methods: Between December 2015 to April 2017, a total of 38 patients with DLD met the inclusion criteria for TBCB in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, and 35 of them consented to undergo the procedure under rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. On the tissues obtained from the 35 patients, histopathologic and microbiological evaluations were performed, and together with clinical and radiological manifestations, diagnoses were made and the efficacy of TBCB in the diagnosis of DLD was confirmed, and then therapies were planned accordingly. Complications of the biopsy procedures were recorded. Results: Of the 35 patients who were enrolled, 24 underwent TBCB under rigid bronchoscopy and 11 under flexible bronchoscopy. Another 3 patients refused the procedure due to disinclination to invasive examinations. One single procedure of TBCB took (51.8+/-19.2) min on average, the median number of tissues obtained was 6 (5, 8), and the median area of tissues was 15 (9, 20) mm(2). Definite diagnoses were reached in 33 patients, including idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (n=8), connective tissue disease-interstitial lung disease (n=8), occupational lung disease (n=4), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n=3), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (n=3), tuberculosis (n=2), cryptogenic organization pneumonia (n=1), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=1), pulmonary infection (n=1), hypersensitivity pneumonia (n=1) and sarcoidosis (n=1). Diagnostic yield was 94.3% (33 out of 35 cases diagnosed). Pneumothorax occurred in 3 patients (1 patients with mild pneumothorax , 1 moderate and 1 severe), and were resolved with thoracic puncture or pleural drainage. Bleeding occurred in all 24 patients who received TBCB under rigid bronchoscopy (11 patients with mild bleeding, 12 moderate and 1 severe) and was controlled after coagulation measures. After one month of treatment according to the diagnoses acquired with cryobiopsy, the condition was cured in 1 patient (3.0%), alleviated in 17 (51.5%), stable in 11 (33.3%), and deteriorated in 4 (12.1%). Conclusion: TBCB yields reliable diagnoses with a good safety profile.

AB  - The term "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF) has been recently proposed. We here investigate the clinical characteristics of IPAF and evaluate the clinical implications of CXCL1-CXCR2 axis in IPAF. An increased plasma level of CXCL1 was exhibited in IPAF compared to idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and healthy controls. Additionally, plasma CXCL1 levels were clinically associated with diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and involved parenchyma extension in IPAF. Furthermore, circulating CXCL1 levels were highest in IPAF patients with acute exacerbations. CXCR2, the chemokine receptor for CXCL1, was readily observed in inflammatory aggregates and endothelial cells in IPAF lungs, but was lower in IIP lungs and healthy lungs. Interestingly, increased CXCL1 concentrations in BALF paralleled neutrophil counts in IPAF. Overall, the plasma concentrations of CXCL1 indicated the disease activity and prognosis in IPAF. Thus, the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis appears to be involved in the progression of IPAF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) have been reported to occur in 7% to 10% of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but their clinical relevance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ANCAs in a North American population with IPF and evaluate their clinical significance., METHODS: This was a retrospective study of two independent cohorts of patients diagnosed with IPF at the University of California San Francisco (discovery cohort) and the University of Chicago (replication cohort). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCAs were measured in all patients. Prevalence and associations of ANCAs with clinical characteristics and transplant-free survival were evaluated., RESULTS: A total of 14 of 353 (4.0%; 95% CI, 2.2-6.5) and 20 of 392 (5.1%; 95% CI, 3.1-7.8) patients with IPF were positive for ANCAs at the time of diagnosis in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Among those positive for MPO antibodies, two of six (33%) in the discovery cohort and three of 12 (25%) in the replication cohort developed vasculitis. None of the patients who were PR3-positive developed vasculitis. Patients who were ANCA-positive were more likely to be women than patients who were ANCA-negative, and were more likely to have some ground-glass opacities on CT scan. In the combined cohort of 745 patients, median transplant-free survival was not significantly different in patients who were ANCA-positive vs ANCA-negative (P = .57)., CONCLUSIONS: ANCA positivity is uncommon in North American patients with IPF and not associated with baseline disease severity or transplant-free survival; however, a significant proportion of patients who are MPO-positive with IPF develop clinical vasculitis.

AB  - Introduction: Despite extensive multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment, some patients have interstitial lung disease (ILD) that is considered unclassifiable (uILD), for which there are currently no approved treatments. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of the antifibrotic pirfenidone in treating uILD., Methods and analysis: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial is enrolling adults with fibrosing ILD, including uILD that fulfils proposed research criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), that cannot be classified with moderate or high confidence to any category of ILD following MDT discussion. Study participants must have >10% fibrosis on high-resolution CT scan within the previous 12 months, forced vital capacity (FVC) >=45% and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide >=30% of predicted values. Study participants will be randomised to receive 801 mg pirfenidone or placebo three times daily for 24 weeks. The efficacy of pirfenidone vs placebo will be assessed by daily measurement of FVC using a handheld spirometer over the treatment period. Other functional parameters, patient-reported outcomes, samples for biomarker analysis and safety endpoints will be collected. Additionally, the study will assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone with and without concomitant mycophenolate mofetil treatment and in study participants with or without IPAF., Ethics and dissemination: This trial is being conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Declaration of Helsinki and local laws for countries in which the research is conducted., Trial registration number: NCT03099187.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, no approved pharmacotherapies are available for unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is characterised by progressive fibrosis of the lung. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD., METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 70 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Eligible patients (aged >=18-85 years) had progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD, a percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45% or higher and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) of 30% or higher, more than 10% fibrosis on high-resolution CT, and a high-resolution CT from the previous 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2403 mg oral pirfenidone daily or placebo using a central validated interactive voice or web-based response system, stratified by concomitant mycophenolate mofetil use and presence or absence of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Investigators, site personnel, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was mean predicted change in FVC from baseline over 24 weeks, measured by daily home spirometry. Secondary endpoints were change in FVC measured by site spirometry, proportion of patients who had a more than 5% or more than 10% absolute or relative decline in percent predicted FVC measured by clinic-based spirometry, change in percent predicted DLco, change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), change in University of California San Diego-Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) score, change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in cough visual analogue scale, and changes in total and subscores of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), all of which were compared with baseline. Additional secondary endpoints included proportion of patients who had non-elective hospitalisation (respiratory and all-cause) and acute exacerbations, and progression-free survival. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099187, and is no longer recruiting., FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2017, and June 5, 2018, 253 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2403 mg pirfenidone (n=127) or placebo (n=126) and were included in the ITT analysis set. Analysis of the primary endpoint was affected by intraindividual variability in home spirometry values, which prevented application of the prespecified statistical model. Over 24 weeks, predicted median change in FVC measured by home spirometry was -87.7 mL (Q1-Q3 -338.1 to 148.6) in the pirfenidone group versus -157.1 mL (-370.9 to 70.1) in the placebo group. Over 24 weeks, predicted mean change in FVC measured by site spirometry was lower in patients given pirfenidone than placebo (treatment difference 95.3 mL [95% CI 35.9 to 154.6], p=0.002). Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pirfenidone group were less likely to have a decline in FVC of more than 5% (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% CI 0.25 to 0.69], p=0.001) or more than 10% (OR 0.44 [0.23 to 0.84], p=0.011). At week 24, mean change in DLco from baseline was -0.7% (SD 7.1) for the pirfenidone group and -2.5% (8.8) for the placebo group, and mean change in 6MWD from baseline was -2.0 m (68.1) for the pirfenidone group and -26.7 m (79.3) for the placebo group. Changes from baseline in UCSD-SOBQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, cough visual analogue scale, and SGRQ scores were similar between the pirfenidone and placebo groups at week 24. Analysis of acute exacerbations, hospital admissions, and time to death from respiratory causes during the study yielded no meaningful results due to a small number of events. No differences in progression-free survival were identified between the pirfenidone and placebo groups, irrespective of the definition of progression-free survival used. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 120 (94%) of 127 patients in the pirfenidone group and 101 (81%) of 124 patients in the placebo group. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 18 (14%) patients in the pirfenidone group and 20 (16%) patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (60 [47%] in the pirfenidone group vs 32 [26%] in the placebo group), fatigue (16 [13%] vs 12 [10%]), and rash (13 [10%] vs nine [7%])., INTERPRETATION: Although the planned statistical model could not be applied to the primary endpoint data, analysis of key secondary endpoints suggests that patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD could benefit from pirfenidone treatment, which has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings support further investigation of pirfenidone as an effective treatment for patients with progressive fibrotic unclassifiable ILD., FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.

AB  - Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a recently proposed terminology for interstitial lung disease (ILD) with evidence of autoimmunity that does not meet the criteria for a defined connective tissue disease (CTD). Although ILD is well recognised in patients with established CTD, it is rarely the sole presenting feature of CTD. We report a case of 22-year-old male patient, who presented with progressive shortness of breath for 2 months and had features suggestive of platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS). Imaging revealed ILD with usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. Patient had features of autoimmune disorder but did not fulfil the criteria for any CTD and hence was labelled as IPAF. His POS was attributed predominantly to the lower lobe disease. The patient responded well to immunosuppressive treatment. A systematic review of literature of all cases with POS due to pulmonary parenchymal involvement has also been done. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019. No commercial re-use.

AB  - Objectives: International experts recently characterized interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) as a provisional diagnosis for patients with interstitial lung disease who have characteristics of autoimmune disease but do not meet criteria for a specific autoimmune disease. We describe clinical characteristics of IPAF patients and examine responses to mycophenolate as a therapy for IPAF., Methods: This retrospective cohort included adult patients meeting European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society classification criteria for IPAF. Sociodemographic, clinical, and pulmonary function test data were abstracted for patients with and without mycophenolate treatment and followed longitudinally from interstitial lung disease diagnosis for change in pulmonary function test results., Results: We identified 52 patients who met criteria for IPAF. Of 52 IPAF patients, 24 did not receive mycophenolate and 28 did, with median time to mycophenolate treatment 22 months. Changes in FVC% and percentage predicted lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) between the mycophenolate-treated and untreated groups were not significantly different (FVC% change P=0.08, DLCO% change P=0.17). However, there was a trend toward more rapid baseline decline of both FVC% and DLCO% in the mycophenolate-treated cohort before vs after mycophenolate therapy. The slope of both FVC% and DLCO% values improved after onset of mycophenolate exposure for the treated group, although this finding was not statistically significant., Conclusion: Patients with IPAF might benefit from mycophenolate therapy. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of mycophenolate for patients who meet criteria for IPAF.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a large group of pulmonary conditions sharing common clinical, radiological and histopathological features as a consequence of fibrosis of the lung interstitium. The majority of ILDs are idiopathic in nature with possible genetic predisposition, but is also well recognised as a complication of connective tissue disease or with certain environmental, occupational or drug exposures. In recent years, a concerted international effort has been made to standardise the diagnostic criteria in ILD subtypes, formalise multidisciplinary pathways and standardise treatment recommendations. In this review, we discuss some of the current challenges around ILD diagnostics, the role of serological testing, especially, in light of the new classification of Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF) and discuss the evidence for therapies targeted at idiopathic and immune-related pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms that are also found in other conditions. This study aimed to evaluate manifestations at disease onset and to compare early SLE manifestations to those of diseases mimicking SLE., METHODS: Academic lupus centers in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America collected baseline data on patients who were referred to them during the previous 3 years for possible SLE and who had a symptom duration of <1 year. Clinical and serologic manifestations were compared between patients diagnosed as having SLE and those diagnosed as having SLE-mimicking conditions. Diagnostic performance of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) SLE classification criteria was tested., RESULTS: Data were collected on 389 patients with early SLE and 227 patients with SLE-mimicking conditions. Unexplained fever was more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions (34.5% versus 13.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). Features less common in early SLE included Raynaud's phenomenon (22.1% versus 48.5%; P < 0.001), sicca symptoms (4.4% versus 34.4%; P < 0.001), dysphagia (0.3% versus 6.2%; P < 0.001), and fatigue (28.3% versus 37.0%; P = 0.024). Anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-beta2 -glycoprotein I antibodies, positive Coombs' test results, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypocomplementemia, and leukopenia were more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions. Symptoms detailed in the ACR and SLICC classification criteria were significantly more frequent among those with early SLE. Fewer patients with early SLE were not identified as having early SLE with use of the SLICC criteria compared to the ACR criteria (16.5% versus 33.9%), but the ACR criteria demonstrated higher specificity than the SLICC criteria (91.6% versus 82.4%)., CONCLUSION: In this multicenter cohort, clinical manifestations that could help to distinguish early SLE from SLE-mimicking conditions were identified. These findings may aid in earlier SLE diagnosis and provide information for ongoing initiatives to revise SLE classification criteria. Copyright © 2018, American College of Rheumatology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinico-radio-pathological characteristics and prognostic factors of unclassifiable-idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (U-IIPs) diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy., METHODS: Among 86 patients with interstitial pneumonia who underwent surgical lung biopsy from January 2005 to September 2013, 33 (38.4%; 16 male patients; mean age, 64.4 +/- 8.8 years) were diagnosed with U-IIPs. They were subsequently categorized into rapidly progressive (n = 7), slowly progressive (n = 7), and stable (n = 19) groups based on the decrease of the percent predicted forced vital capacity or percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung carbon monoxide and the occurrence of acute exacerbation. The clinico-radio-pathological features and survival rates of the patients who were followed up for at least 3 years were examined. These cases were reevaluated retrospectively by multidisciplinary discussion., RESULTS: The rapidly progressive group had a significantly poorer prognosis than that of the other groups (p < 0.0001). Although there were no significant pattern differences on the chest high-resolution computed tomography, the fibrosis scores were significantly higher in the rapidly progressive group (p = 0.002). Furthermore, the percentage of fibroblastic foci assessed by the pathological analysis was also significantly higher in the rapidly progressive group (p = 0.006). Nine (27.3%) patients developed connective tissue diseases during follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: The radiologic patterns were not significantly different among the three clinical U-IIPs subgroups. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that the fibrosis scores and the percentage of fibroblastic foci could provide a prognostic assessment in U-IIPs.

AB  - CONTEXT: - Interstitial lung disease, a common complication observed in several connective tissue diseases, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Similar to individuals with connective tissue diseases, a significant subgroup of patients with clinical and serologic characteristics suggestive of autoimmunity but without confirmed specific connective tissue disease presents with associated interstitial lung disease. These patients have been classified using different controversial nomenclatures, such as undifferentiated connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease, lung-dominant connective tissue disease, and autoimmune featured interstitial lung disease. The need for a better understanding and standardization of this entity, interstitial lung disease with autoimmune features, and the need for an adequate management protocol for patients resulted in the introduction of a new terminology in 2015: interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. This new classification requires a better comprehension of its diagnostic impact and the influence of its morphologic aspects on the prognosis of patients., OBJECTIVE: - To review the diagnostic criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, with an emphasis on morphologic aspects., DATA SOURCES: - The review is based on the available literature, and on pathologic, radiologic, and clinical experience., CONCLUSIONS: - The interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features classification seems to identify a distinct subgroup of patients with different prognoses. Studies show that nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and usual interstitial pneumonia are the most prevalent morphologic patterns and show discrepant results on the impact of the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on survival. Prospective investigations are necessary to better define this subgroup and to determine the prognosis and appropriate clinical management of these patients.

AB  - Heterozygous mutations in four telomere-related genes have been linked to pulmonary fibrosis, but little is known about similarities or differences of affected individuals.115 patients with mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) (n=75), telomerase RNA component (TERC) (n=7), regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) (n=14) and poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) (n=19) were identified and clinical data were analysed.Approximately one-half (46%) had a multidisciplinary diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); others had unclassifiable lung fibrosis (20%), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (12%), pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (10%), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (7%), an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (4%) and connective tissue disease-related interstitial fibrosis (3%). Discordant interstitial lung disease diagnoses were found in affected individuals from 80% of families. Patients with TERC mutations were diagnosed at an earlier age than those with PARN mutations (51+/-11 years versus 64+/-8 years; p=0.03) and had a higher incidence of haematological comorbidities. The mean rate of forced vital capacity decline was 300 mL.year-1 and the median time to death or transplant was 2.87 years. There was no significant difference in time to death or transplant for patients across gene mutation groups or for patients with a diagnosis of IPF versus a non-IPF diagnosis.Genetic mutations in telomere related genes lead to a variety of interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnoses that are universally progressive.

AB  - Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), MUC5B rs35705950 and TOLLIP rs5743890 have been associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In this observational cohort study, we assessed the associations between these genomic markers and outcomes of survival and rate of disease progression in patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF, n=250) and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD, n=248). IPF (n=499) was used as a comparator. The LTL of IPAF and CTD-ILD patients (mean age-adjusted log-transformed T/S of -0.05+/-0.29 and -0.04+/-0.25, respectively) is longer than that of IPF patients (-0.17+/-0.32). For IPAF patients, LTL <10th percentile is associated with faster lung function decline compared to LTL >=10th percentile (-6.43% per year versus -0.86% per year; p<0.0001) and worse transplant-free survival (hazard ratio 2.97, 95% CI 1.70-5.20; p=0.00014). The MUC5B rs35705950 minor allele frequency (MAF) is greater for IPAF patients (23.2, 95% CI 18.8-28.2; p<0.0001) than controls and is associated with worse transplant-free IPAF survival (hazard ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.18-3.13; p=0.0091). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has a shorter LTL than non-RA CTD-ILD (-0.14+/-0.27 versus -0.01+/-0.23; p=0.00055) and higher MUC5B MAF (34.6, 95% CI 24.4-46.3 versus 14.1, 95% CI 9.8-20.0; p=0.00025). Neither LTL nor MUC5B are associated with transplant-free CTD-ILD survival.LTL and MUC5B MAF have different associations with lung function progression and survival for IPAF and CTD-ILD.

AB  - Some patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) have clinical features that suggest autoimmune process but not fulfill established criteria for connective tissue disease (CTD). Different terms and criteria have been proposed to describe these patients, which includes undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), lung dominant connective tissue disease (LD-CTD), and autoimmune-featured interstitial lung disease (AIF-ILD). To marshal these ununiform classification criteria, the "European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society Task Force on Undifferentiated Forms of Connective Tissue Disease-associated Interstitial Lung Disease" proposed a consensus regarding the nomenclature and classification criteria for patients with IIP and features of autoimmunity with the term "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF). It was reported that patients with IPAF accounted for 7.3%~34.1% of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). Survival, rate of progressing to CTD, appropriate treatment, and treatment response are not yet elucidated. Furthermore, it is not determined whether IPAF is a distinct category of ILD or simply a part of IIP. These questions should be elucidated by future prospective cohort studies. Hopefully, rheumatologists should participate in not only clinical trials but also in multidisciplinary discussions for IPAF.

AB  - A 71-year-old woman with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) presented with prolonged cough. No physical findings suggested the presence of any connective tissue diseases. Chest computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities and consolidations in the bilateral lower lobes. She had elevated serum Krebs von den Lungen-6, hypoxemia and positive serum anti-Jo-1 antibody. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed lymphocytosis with a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed organizing pneumonia. Based on a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), systemic corticosteroids were administered, and a good outcome was obtained. A possible relationship between CRS and IPAF is herein discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality is similarly high among individuals with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Circulating anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are commonly found in this patient population, suggesting possible aberrant immune activation. Because an environment of oxidative stress can result from immunologic activation, we hypothesized that ANA positive patients with UIP would have improved outcome when exposed to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) compared to ANA negative patients., METHODS: A single center, retrospective cohort analysis was performed. Patients with UIP due to IPF and IPAF were stratified according to ANA status to and NAC exposure. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and multivariable Cox regression adjusted for diagnosis, gender/age/physiology score, immunosuppressant exposure and anti-fibrotic exposure., RESULTS: Of 293 individuals with UIP due to IPF (74%) or IPAF (26%), NAC exposure was documented in 58 (19.8%). Among NAC exposed individuals, 33 (56.9%) were ANA seropositive and 25 (43.1%) were seronegative. NAC exposure was associated with improved TFS survival among ANA seropositive individuals in unadjusted analysis (plogrank = 0.02) and after multi-variable adjustment (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87; p = 0.01). There was no association between NAC exposure and TFS in ANA seronegative individuals (HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.69-2.32; p = 0.45). Formal interaction testing confirmed NAC*ANA interaction (p = 0.04) and sensitivity analysis demonstrated an increasing effect size associated with NAC therapy as ANA titer increased. Among patients with available genetic data, a marginally higher proportion of ANA positive patients (p = 0.08) carried the rs3750920 (TOLLIP) genotype previously shown to predict favorable outcome in NAC exposed patients., CONCLUSION: NAC exposure is associated with improved transplant-free survival ANA positive patients with UIP. These findings support the prospective collection of ANA data in in future NAC clinical trials performed in patients with UIP.

AB  - Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a term to describe individuals with both interstitial lung disease (ILD) and combinations of other clinical, serologic, and/or pulmonary morphologic features, which presumably originate from an underlying systemic autoimmune condition, but do not meet current rheumatologic criteria for a defined connective tissue disease (CTD). Predominantly, interstitial pneumonia arises in the course of an established CTD, but it is not so rare for the ILD to be the first, and possibly the one and only manifestation of a latent CTD. Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP) is an uncommon disease, characterized by infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar spaces of the lung by lymphocytes, plasma cells and other lymphoreticular elements. The cause of LIP is still unknown but it could be also a manifestation of CTD. Clinically, it is highly variable, from spontaneous resolution to progressive respiratory failure and death despite glucocorticoid treatment. Since there are no recent standards for the management of LIP, the disease is treated empirically. We report a case of a HIV-negative 54-year-old woman, who was suspected of LIP according to clinical features and radiological findings. Positive laboratory results were highly suggestive of underlying autoimmune process, but did not fulfil the criteria of any particular CTD. Because of severe general condition of the patient, immunosuppressive treatment was started immediately, without further invasive diagnostics including lung biopsy, which is required for a definitive diagnosis. We present two-year observation of the patient with all our doubts concerning clinical proceedings.

AB  - Anti-tRNA autoantibodies are associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD), in at least two clinical scenarios: the anti-synthetase syndrome (ASSD) and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Under pathological conditions, cytokines indicate the participating elements and the course of inflammatory phenomena. We aimed to quantify serum concentrations of different inflammatory cytokines profiles in patients with anti-tRNA associated ILD (anti-tRNA-ILD) and estimate the association between these and ILD improvement and progression. Serum levels of 18 cytokines from baseline and after six months of treatment of ILD patients' positives to anti-tRNA were included in the current study. At six months, patients were classified as with or without ILD progression. A total of 39 patients were included (10 anti-Jo1, eight anti-PL7, 11 anti-PL12, and 10 anti-Ej). Three patients (7.6%) had ILD progression (progressors patients, PP) and showed statistically higher levels in IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-22, GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-alpha, compared to patients without disease progression (no progressors patients, NPP). IL-17A, IL-1beta, and IL-6 (T-helper-lymphocyte (Th)17 inflammatory cytokine profile) were elevated and had a high discriminatory capacity in distinguishing ILD PP of those NPP at follow-up. Overall, there is an association between the cytokines of the Th17 inflammatory profile and the ASSD progression.

AB  - Previous studies of the occurrence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in undifferentiated connective tissue diseases (UCTD) were conducted in patients admitted to Respiratory Medicine Units. The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate lung involvement in UCTD patients admitted to a Rheumatology Unit. Eighty-one consecutive UCTD patients were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent history and physical examination, routine laboratory investigations, antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling, B-mode echocardiography, and lung function study according to previously reported methods. Lung high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in patients who provided informed consent. Six patients (7.4%) had a history of grade II dyspnea. Three of them had a DLCO ranging from 42 to 55% of the predicted value; and a HRCT-documented ILD with a non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. Symptoms in the other three patients were due to cardiac disease. None of the 75 asymptomatic patients, had relevant findings at physical examination, 26/75 had a DLCO <80% (<70% in 10 cases). Of these, 3 of the 30 patients who underwent lung HRCT were affected by NSIP-ILD. Six of the 81 enrolled were affected by ILD, which was symptomatic in three patients. A higher percentage of patients had a reduced DLCO. The latter finding may reflect a preradiographic ILD or a preechocardiographic pulmonary vascular disease.

AB  - Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) is an easy tool used for the assessment of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) as possibly associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Recent insights have also highlighted its role in the diagnostic assessment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). The aim of this study is to describe the diagnostic role of NVC in a series of 361 consecutive patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). All the patients were assessed by clinical pulmonary and rheumatic examinations, blood exams, high-resolution computed tomography and NVC. NVC was considered positive only in the presence of avascular areas or giant capillaries, but also, the presence of bushy capillaries (BCs) was recorded. NVC was positive in 17.7% of ILD patients and in 78.1% of ILD patients associated with a diagnosis of connective tissue disease (CTD). In 25% of SSc-ILD patients, NVC proved necessary for a correct diagnosis. The presence of BCs and/or NVC positivity in ILD patients with normal levels of creatine phosphokinase is associated with amyopathic IIM, regardless the presence of RP. In conclusion, NVC is useful for the diagnostic assessment of incomplete forms of CTD and in amyopathic IIMs. NVC should be considered in the diagnostic assessment of ILD patients regardless of the presence of RP.

AB  - The diagnostic assessment of patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) can be challenging due to the large number of possible causes. Moreover, the diagnostic approach can be limited by the severity of the disease, which may not allow invasive exams. To overcome this issue, the referral centers for ILD organized Multidisciplinary Teams (MDTs), including physicians and experts in complementary discipline, to discuss the management of doubtful cases of ILD. MDT is currently considered the gold standard for ILD diagnosis, but it is not often simple to organize and, furthermore, rheumatologists are still not always included. In fact, even if rheumatologic conditions represent a common cause of ILD, they are sometimes difficult to recognize, considering the variegated clinical features and their association with all possible radiographic patterns of ILD. The first objective of this review is to describe the clinical, laboratory, and instrumental tests that can drive a diagnosis toward a possible rheumatic disease. The secondary objective is to propose a set of first-line tests to perform in all patients in order to recognize any possible rheumatic conditions underlying ILD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, clinical presentation, serological and morphological features of, and therapeutic options for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) in primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS)., METHODS: Pubmed was searched between February 1996 and December 2018 using a combination of MESH terms related to pSS and ILD. Selected works were subjected to blind evaluation by two authors and a senior author in case of disagreement. The work followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018118669)., RESULTS: About 20% of pSS patients have ILD, with a 5-y survival of 84% and a need for supplemental oxygen in the 11-33% range. A significant proportion of ILD patients are seronegative without sicca syndrome. ILD seems to be associated with higher levels of Lactic Dehydrogenases and positivity for Anti-Ro52k. The prevalent pattern in High Resolution Computed Tomography is Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP), but all other patterns can be present. No difference in mortality was found between patients with NSIP and Usual Interstitial Pneumonia patterns. Amyloidosis and primary lung lymphoma can be observed in about 10% of pSS patients., CONCLUSION: The recognition of pSS underlying an ILD can be challenging in seronegative patients with no or mild sicca symptoms. A complete diagnostic assessment, including minor salivary glands and, in some cases, lung biopsy, should be performed on all patients at risk. A better recognition of the clinical or serological markers of ILD progression in these patients is warranted to drive the physicians to an early diagnosis and an effective treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Severe morning stiffness with painful involvement of the girdles are often referred by patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), but the association between ILD and Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is rarely reported. The purpose of the work is to describe a series of patients classified as having PMR with ILD., Material and methods: We retrospectively enrolled patients with a diagnosis of PMR referred to our center during the previous year for respiratory symptoms. Data concerning clinical and serological manifestations suggesting Connective Tissue Disease (CTD), High-Resolution Chest Tomography (HRCT), and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) were systematically collected in order to verify the diagnosis., Results: Fifteen out of seventeen PMR patients had ILD. Ten patients had a confirmed diagnosis of PMR, while in five patients a CTD was discovered. Seven patients showed a severe restrictive pattern at PFTs requiring oxygen supplementation (five with PMR and two with CTD). In thirteen patients pulmonary symptoms started before or together with muscular symptoms. Regarding HRCT patterns, patients showed a Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia in nine cases, Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) and possible UIP in two and three cases, and a single case of Organizing Pneumonia and Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema Syndrome., Conclusions: Lung involvement should be evaluated in PMR patients, especially if asthenia is poorly responsive to low doses of steroids. In these cases, the diagnosis should be re-evaluated in depth, looking for a seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis, a clinically amyopathic myositis or Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The term Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF) describes patients with Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) and clinical or serological features of autoimmune diseases insufficient to reach a specific classification of a Connective Tissue Disease (CTD). Currently, retrospective studies on IPAF patients have proven to be heterogeneous in general characteristics, outcomes and High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) pattern. This study aims to describe for the first time the clinical, serological and radiological features of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. This cohort is then compared to a group of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 626 consecutive ILD patients evaluated, 45 IPAF and a comparison cohort of 143 IPF patients were enrolled. All patients underwent clinical assessment with rheumatologic and respiratory evaluation, HRCT, Pulmonary Function Tests and Nailfold Videocapillaroscopy., RESULTS: The IPAF patients had a predominance of female gender (62.12%) with a median age of 66 years. The most common findings were: Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP, 68.89%), Antinuclear Antibody positivity (17.77%) and Raynaud Phenomenon (31.11%). In comparison with IPF, IPAF patients showed younger age, better performances in Pulmonary Function Tests, less necessity of O2 support and predominance of female sex and NSIP pattern., DISCUSSION: This is the first report of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. IPAF patients seem to have a less severe lung disease than IPF. IPAF criteria probably need to be revisited and validated, but their capacity to recruit patients with incomplete forms or early onset of CTD could be useful for further research.

AB  - The term interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has been proposed to define patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with autoimmune signs not classifiable for connective tissue diseases (CTDs). This new definition overcomes previous nomenclatures and provides a uniform structure for prospective studies through specific classification criteria. This work evaluates the characteristics of IPAF patients reported in the literature, to highlight potential limits through a comparative analysis and to suggest better performing classification criteria.Four retrospective studies on the IPAF population have been considered. The study subjects differed in age, sex, smoking habit, ILD pattern and outcomes. Another important difference lies in the diverse items considered in the classification criteria. The retrospective design of the studies and the absence from some of them of a rheumatologist clearly involved in the diagnosis may have influenced the data, but current IPAF criteria seem to include a rather heterogeneous population. To overcome these discrepancies, this review suggests a limitation in the use of single items and the exclusion of extremely specific CTD criteria. This should avoid the definition of IPAF for those diseases at different stages or at early onset. The investigation of a functional or morphological cut-off of pulmonary involvement would be useful.

AB  - Patients with connective tissue diseases may have pulmonary involvement, including interstitial lung disease. Various patterns of interstitial lung disease have been classically described in certain connective tissue diseases. It is now recognized that there is significant overlap between patterns of interstitial lung disease observed in the various connective tissue diseases. Differentiating idiopathic from connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease is challenging but of clinical importance. New concepts in the diagnosis of connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease may prove useful in making the diagnosis. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distinct clinical presentations of interstitial lung disease (ILD) with the myositis-specific antibodies, including anti-synthetase antibodies, are well-recognized. However, the association between ILD and the myositis-associated antibodies, including anti-Ro52, is less established. Our objectives were to compare presenting phenotypes of patients with anti-Ro52 alone versus in combination with myositis-specific autoantibodies and to identify predictors of disease progression or death., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 73 adults with ILD and a positive anti-Ro52 antibody. We report clinical features, treatment, and outcomes., RESULTS: The majority of patients with ILD and anti-Ro52 had no established connective tissue disease (78%), and one-third had no rheumatologic symptoms. Thirteen patients (17.8%) required ICU admission for respiratory failure, with 84.6% all-cause mortality. Of the 73 subjects, 85.7% had a negative SS-A, and 49.3% met criteria for idiopathic pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). The 50 patients with anti-Ro52 alone were indistinguishable from patients with anti-Ro52 plus a myositis-specific autoantibody. ICU admission was associated with poor outcomes (HR 12.97, 95% CI 5.07-34.0, p < 0.0001), whereas rheumatologic symptoms or ANA > = 1:320 were associated with better outcomes (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.16-0.97, p = 0.04, and HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.81, p = 0.03, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Presentations of ILD with the anti-Ro52 antibody are heterogeneous, and outcomes are similar when compared to anti-Ro52 plus myositis-specific antibodies. Testing for anti-Ro52 may help to phenotype unclassifiable ILD patients, particularly as part of the serologic criteria for IPAF. Further research is needed to investigate treatment of ILD in the setting of anti-Ro52 positivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently the term "interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features" (IPAF) has been proposed to identify patients with interstitial lung disease and autoimmune characteristics, not fulfilling the criteria for specific connective tissue diseases (CTD). Only few data are available about the clinical and serological features of IPAF patients, their survival and the possible evolution in a CTD. The aims of the study were to investigate the demographic and clinico-serologic features of patients with IPAF, their relationship to survival, and the possible evolution in a definite CTD., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were consecutively enrolled and prospectively followed for 45 +/- 31.6 months. Data about disease onset, serological, clinical and therapeutic features, pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography were periodically repeated. The survival of patients with IPAF was compared with that of 104 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., RESULTS: The clinical domain for IPAF was satisfied in 44 patients, serological domain in 49 and the morphological domain in 29 patients. During the follow-up, a definite CTD was diagnosed in 7 patients, in particular Sjogren's syndrome in 4 patients, rheumatoid arthritis in 2, and polymyositis in the last. The estimated 5-year survival of IPAF patients 69.5 +/- 7.8%, significantly higher than survival observed in IPF patients, and the baseline value of FVC and DLCO were the only factors associated to death., CONCLUSIONS: IPAF seems to a distinct entity, with a low tendency to evolve in a definite CTD. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to better define the clinical evolution and the outcome of IPAF. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A contemporary joint research statement of the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) proposed criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) as an opening move in a trial to uniformly describe and categorize a subset of patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that exhibit evidence of autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease.[1] Before this consensus report, several studies have focused on the presence of a particular subset of interstitial pneumonia, apparently idiopathic, associated with one or more clinical and serological features, suggesting a possible underlying autoimmune disorder. Several definitions and terminologies have been proposed for this specific form of interstitial pneumonia.[2][3][4] The aforementioned joint consensus opinion was made possible via an international expert panel of thirteen pulmonologists, four rheumatologists, one thoracic radiologist, and one pulmonary pathologist.[5] These classifications were based on a combination of features from three domains: a clinical domain consisting of extrathoracic elements, a serological domain with specific autoantibodies, and a morphological domain with imaging patterns, histopathological findings, and multi-compartment involvement.

AB  - A brief review of literature is made on the problem of modern classification, diagnosis and treatment of systemic vasculitis. The authors present a clinical case of a 40-YO male, in whom the disease started with focal neurological signs: epileptic seizures, disorder of consciousness, light euphoria, nasolabial fold insufficiency and left upper extremity hypoesthesia. Initial examination revealed upper sagittal sinus together with right lateral sinus thrombosis with forming of bilateral frontal lobe's hemorrhages; development of stable thrombocytopenia and platelet antibodies in blood species as well as hyperhomocysteinemia and a MTHFR gene mutation. Further, the patient was followed-up by the hematologist and treated by steroids. Systemic vasculitis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) were late diagnosed in this patient, and coexistence of two systemic vasculitis predetermined extremely severe course of the disease with fatal outcome in nearly 5 years after the disease started, and after steroid and rituximab treatment. It is concluded that the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis in a young patient should exclude systemic vasculitis as one of its possible causes.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review the newly formulated and published research classification criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features and appraise these criteria in light of findings from recent investigations., RECENT FINDINGS: Previous studies demonstrated that interstitial pneumonia may be caused by an autoimmune process with a variety of names and criteria utilized for this entity. To standardize terminology and provide a definition for future research, a multidisciplinary task force formulated criteria by which patients with interstitial lung disease and autoimmune features might be recognized. The interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features criteria require the presence of an interstitial pneumonia on chest imaging or surgical lung biopsy, exclusion of an alternate cause, the absence of a defined connective tissue disease and at least one feature suggestive of autoimmunity from at least two of three domains: clinical with specific extra-thoracic features, serologic with positive autoantibodies and morphologic as demonstrated by chest imaging, histopathology, or multicompartment involvement. Although recent studies provide insight into features of significance, these criteria have not undergone formal validation., SUMMARY: A uniform name and set of research criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features may identify patients with treatment responsive interstitial lung disease and an improved prognosis. These criteria require validation before they can be applied in the clinical setting.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common manifestation of connective tissue disease (CTD). Although the majority of patients with CTD-ILD are stable or slowly progressive, a significant group exhibits a more severe and progressive decline. Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) describes the subset of patients with interstitial pneumonia who have features suggesting underlying autoimmunity, but whose features fall short of a clear diagnosis of CTD. Areas covered: In this focused review, we discuss recent advances in early detection, prognostic evaluation, and management of autoimmune forms of ILD. Expert commentary: Early detection of ILD and a better understanding of factors that impact prognostication may be helpful when making decisions regarding therapeutic interventions. The treatment of CTD-ILD should be comprehensive, is often fraught with challenges and can be complicated by comorbid conditions and extra-thoracic disease activities. Several large randomized studies have examined the impact of immunosuppressive therapy for CTD-ILD, however, additional studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment strategies. Future studies may provide additional information about the best treatments in patients with IPAF.

AB  - In systemic sclerosis, the presence of an anti-RNA polymerase III antibody (ARNpol3) is associated with an increased risk of cancer. The characteristic picture of this serotype includes severe diffuse cutaneous involvement, a high risk of renal scleroderma crisis and a 10 year survival of only around 30%. Pulmonary involvement is less common. We report the case of a woman initially treated for drug-induced acute interstitial lung disease revealing chronic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. The disease evolved in three stages with the occurrence of a rapidly progressive diffuse skin sclerosis with anti-ARNPol3 antibodies in the context of ovarian cancer remission. Copyright © 2020 SPLF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (chILD) refer to a rare heterogeneous group of disorders. Global collaborations have been working on the etiologies and classification scheme of chILD. With the development of medical technologies, some new diseases were identified to be associated with chILD and its etiologic spectrum is expanding. The aim of this study is to describe the etiologic spectrum of chILD in children older than 2 years of age and summarize the approaches to diagnosis of chILD., METHODS: We made a retrospective analysis of children older than 2 years of age with chILD who referred to Beijing Children's Hospital from 21 provinces all over China from 2013 to 2018. After excluding pulmonary infection, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis, 133 patients were included and categorized by etiology. Clinical manifestations, high-resolution computed tomography, laboratory data, genetic data and pathologic findings were all collected and reviewed., RESULTS: Systemic disease associated ILD were the most common causes, accounting for 49.6% of the patients, followed by alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD (27%), exposure related ILD (13.5%), and disorders masquerading as ILD (3.8%). In systemic disease associated ILD, in addition to common etiologies such as vasculitis (10.5%) and connective tissue diseases (9.0%), primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) associated ILD (9.8%), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (6.8%), and metabolic diseases (6.8%) were not rarely found. Some newly reported etiologies such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy, COPA syndrome and STAT3 mutation were included in PID associated ILD. Genetic tests contributed to 15% of the diagnoses which mainly distributed in PID associated ILD, metabolic diseases and surfactant dysfunction disorders, and contributed to the final diagnoses more than lung biopsies (13.5%) and biopsies of rashes or other tissues (12%)., CONCLUSIONS: This study first demonstrated an etiologic spectrum of chILD in Chinese children older than 2 years of age and summarized the approaches to diagnosis. The etiologic spectrum of chILD is expanding with more genetic etiologies being recognized.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This retrospective clinical study aimed to examine the similarities and differences between connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and to identify the influencing factors of CTD-ILD, with a goal of early detection and active treatment of the disease., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 480 patients: 412 with CTD-ILD and 68 with IPAF. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging data were analyzed., RESULTS: Compared with the IPAF group, the CTD-ILD group contained more women, and the incidences of joint pain, dry mouth/dry eyes, and Raynaud's phenomenon were higher; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-dimer levels were higher; red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were lower; a high rheumatoid factor (RF) titer (> 2 times the normal upper limit) was observed, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP), anti-keratin antibody (AKA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody (anti-MDA5) levels were higher. Compared with CTD-ILD patients, IPAF patients were more likely to present initially with respiratory symptoms, with higher rates of fever, cough and expectoration, dyspnea, and Velcro crackles; anti-Ro52 titers were higher; incidences of honeycombing opacity, reticulate opacity, patchy opacity, and pleural thickening were greater. Female sex, a high RF titer (> 2 times the normal upper limit), anti-CCP positivity, ANA positivity, and anti-MDA5 positivity were risk factors for CTD-ILD when the odds ratios were adjusted., CONCLUSION: CTD-ILD and IPAF patients differed in demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, and chest HRCT imaging data. Female sex, a high RF titer (> 2 times the normal upper limit), anti-CCP positivity, ANA positivity, and anti-MDA5 positivity were risk factors for CTD-ILD.Key Points* This retrospective clinical study comprehensively compared the demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, and chest HRCT imaging data of CTD-ILD and IPAF patients.* The evidence suggested that female sex, a high RF titer, anti-CCP positivity, ANA positivity, and anti-MDA5 positivity were risk factors for CTD-ILD.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a wide range of parenchymal lung pathologies with different clinical, histological, radiological, and serological features. Follow-up, treatment, and prognosis are strongly influenced by the underlying pathogenesis. Considering that an ILD may complicate the course of any connective tissue disease (CTD) and that CTD's signs are not always easily identifiable, it could be useful to screen every ILD patient for a possible CTD. The recent definition of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features is a further confirmation of the close relationship between CTD and ILD. In this context, the multidisciplinary approach is assuming a growing and accepted role in the correct diagnosis and follow-up, to as early as possible define the best therapeutic strategy. However, despite clinical advantages, until now, the pathways of the multidisciplinary approach in ILD patients are largely heterogeneous across different centers and the best strategy to apply is still to be established and validated. Aims of this article are to describe the organization of our multidisciplinary group for ILD, which is mainly focused on the early identification and management of CTD in patients with ILD and to show our results in a 1 year period of observation. We found that 15% of patients referred for ILD had an underlying CTD, 33% had interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune feature, and 52% had ILD without detectable CTD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the adoption of a standardized strategy consisting of a screening questionnaire, specific laboratory tests, and nailfold videocapillaroscopy in all incident ILD proved useful in making the right diagnosis.

AB  - Between September 2015 and August 2016 there were >1500 publications in the field of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs). For the Clinical Year in Review session at the European Respiratory Society Congress that was held in London, UK, in September 2016, we selected only five articles. This selection, made from the enormous number of published papers, does not include all the relevant studies that will significantly impact our knowledge in the field of DPLDs in the near future. This review article provides our personal view on the following topics: early diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, current knowledge on the multidisciplinary team diagnosis of DPLDs and the diagnostic role of transbronchial cryobiopsy in this diagnostic setting, insights on the new entity of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, and new therapeutic approaches for scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the most serious pulmonary complications of connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and it is characterized by a deep impact on morbidity and mortality. Due to the poor knowledge of CTD-ILD's natural history and due to the difficulties related to design of randomized control trials, there is a lack of prospective data about the prevalence, follow-up, and therapeutic efficacy. For these reasons, the choice of therapy for CTD-ILD is currently very challenging and still largely based on experts' opinion. Treatment is often based on steroids and conventional immunosuppressive drugs, but the recent publication of the encouraging results of the INBUILD trial has highlighted a possible effective and safe use of antifibrotic drugs as a new therapeutic option for these subjects. Aim of this review is to summarize the available data and recent advances about therapeutic strategies for ILD in the context of various CTD, such as systemic sclerosis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and Sjogren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease and undifferentiated connective tissue disease, and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, focusing also on ongoing clinical trials.

AB  - Information about the prognosis and natural history of autoimmune interstitial lung diseases (Ai-ILD) is limited. The aim of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of patients diagnosed with Ai-ILD in Latin-America. We conducted an ambispective multicenter cohort study in 25 centers of Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay between January 2015 and April 2018. Participants were included in the study if they had diagnosis of Ai-ILD performed by a multidisciplinary team. Patients were classified into the following sub-groups: connective tissue disease-associated ILD (ILD-CTD), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), and positive antineutrophils cytoplasmatic antibodies associated ILD (ILD-ANCA). All images were reviewed by a blinded thoracic radiologist. Out of the 381 patients included during the study period, 282 (74%; 95% CI; 69.39-78.16) were women. Mean age was 58years old (SD 16). Three-hundred and twenty-five (85.1%; 95% CI 81.39-88.5) patients were classified as ILD-CTD (rheumatoid arthritis 31%, systemic sclerosis 29%, dermatomyositis 15%). Thirty-six patients were classified as IPAF (9.5%; 95% CI 6.9-12.8), and 13 (3.5%; 95% CI 2-5.75) as ILD-ANCA. Fifty percent of patients (95% CI 45.12-55.43) had a mild decrease of the forced vital capacity at the time of diagnosis. The most common treatment strategy was the combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (30.1%; 95% CI 25.32-35.34) followed by azathioprine (20,3%; 95% CI 16.32-25.14). In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the characteristics and treatment strategies used in patients affected by Ai-ILD in Latin-America. Future studies should to evaluate the prognosis and impact of current treatment strategies in patients with Ai-ILD. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is growing speculation that idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is, in reality, a grouping of separate disorders with a common histologic pattern. In this review, distinct clinical, imaging, and serologic features providing support for this premise are detailed and discussed., RECENT FINDINGS: The diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP is often uncertain because of its clinical and imaging diversity. In a landmark study of inter-multidisciplinary group diagnostic variation, there were striking discrepancies between seven expert groups (kappa = 0.24) in diagnoses of idiopathic NSIP. Recent histologic observations provide support for the concept of an NSIP/organizing pneumonia overlap, distinct from isolated NSIP. An important group of NSIP patients with features of 'undifferentiated connective disease', historically classified as an idiopathic NSIP subgroup, have been shown to have a lower mortality than idiopathic NSIP patients without features of autoimmune disease. The recently proposed entity of 'interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features' includes many patients with a histologic or imaging pattern of NSIP, shown by Oldham and colleagues to have a similar survival to patients with connective tissue disease-related NSIP., SUMMARY: The concept of idiopathic NSIP as a grouping of separate disorders with a common histologic pattern provides a template for potentially important pathogenetic insights.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated ILD. While some patients meet clear classification criteria for a systemic rheumatic disease, a subset of patients do not meet classification criteria but still benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. In 2015, the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society described classification criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) to identify patients with lung-predominant CTD who lack sufficient features of a systemic rheumatic disease to meet classification criteria. Although these criteria are imperfect, they are an important attempt to classify the patient with undifferentiated disease for future study. Rheumatologists play a key role in the evaluation of potential IPAF in patients, especially as many patients with a myositis-spectrum disease (e.g., non-Jo-1 antisynthetase syndrome, anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 antibody inflammatory myositis, or anti-PM/Scl antibody-associated inflammatory myositis) would be classified under IPAF using the currently available criteria for inflammatory myositis, and would therefore benefit from rheumatologic comanagement. The aim of this review was to describe the historical context that led to the development of these criteria and to discuss the limitations of the current criteria, diagnostic challenges, treatment options, and strategies for disease monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological markers Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein-A (SP-A), SP-D, chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and chemokine 13 (CXCL13) in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP)., METHODS: Patients with IIP aged 18-80 years from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were enrolled in this retrospective case-control study. Data on the general patient characteristics, laboratory test results, chest high-resolution CT, and pulmonary function test results were collected. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was based on the international practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IPF, a collaborative effort published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Association (ERS), Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Society. The diagnostic criteria of non-IPF (N-IPF) followed the consensus classification of the IIPs, which was jointly issued by the ATS and ERS in 2002. The diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was based on the official research statement on IPAF, which was jointly issued by the ATS and ERS in 2015. Serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, CCL2, and CXCL13 were measured. The differences in the expression of these biomarkers and their correlation with the severity of the disease were analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity, cutoff value, and area under the curve (AUC) value for each of the indices were determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis., FINDINGS: Between September 2015 and October 2017, 69 patients with IIP. Of these patients, 19 had IPF, 23 had N-IPF, and 27 had IPAF. We also enrolled 20 age- and gender-matched patients with pneumonia and 15 uninfected individuals as normal control. The serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, -SP-D, CCL2, and CXCL13 were significantly higher in patients with IIP than in patients with pneumonia and the normal controls. The detection of these markers was found to have better diagnostic efficacy in patients with IIP than in those with pneumonia. Of these markers above, KL-6 had the highest diagnostic value (AUC 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99). Based on a logistics regression analysis, the combination of KL-6, CCL2, and CXCL13 had an improved diagnostic efficacy for IIP. In patients with IIP, the serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, CCL2, and CXCL13 all showed a significant negative correlation with the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO; r = -0.36, -0.37, -0.36, -0.30, respectively; all p < 0.05). Although their expression levels along with that of SP-D were elevated in patients with IPF, N-IPF, and IPAF, it was difficult to distinguish between these 3 conditions by detecting the 5 serum biomarkers together. Our findings indicate that the serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, CCL2, and CXCL13 are notably elevated in patients with IIP and show significant correlation with the severity of interstitial lung lesions. Additionally, we further explore the diagnostic efficacy of 5 biomarkers in different types of IIP. It is the first time that the level of serum marker CXCL13 of N-IPF and IPAF patients was higher than IPF patients, which further enriched the study on serum markers for IIPs. Between September 2015 and October 2017, 69 patients with IIP. Of these patients, 19 had IPF, 23 had N-IPF, and 27 had IPAF. We also enrolled 20 age- and gender-matched patients with pneumonia and 15 uninfected individuals as normal control. The serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, CCL2, and CXCL13 were significantly higher in patients with IIP than in patients with pneumonia and the normal controls. Of these markers above, KL-6 had the highest diagnostic value (AUC 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99). Based on a logistics regression analysis, the combination of KL-6, CCL2, and CXCL13 had an improved diagnostic efficacy for IIP. In patients with IIP, the serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, CCL2, and CXCL13 all showed a significant negative correlation with the DLCO (r = -0.36, -0.37, -0.36, -0. 0, respectively; all p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that the serum levels of KL-6, -SP-A, SP-D, CCL2, and CXCL13 are notably elevated in patients with IIP and show significant correlation with the severity of interstitial lung lesions. Additionally, we further explore the diagnostic efficacy of 5 biomarkers in different types of IIP. It is the first time that the level of serum marker CXCL13 of N-IPF and IPAF patients was higher than IPF patients, which further enrich the study on serum markers in IIPs., INTERPRETATION: Although the combined detection of KL-6, CCL3, and CXCL13 significantly improves the diagnosis of IIP, detection of all the 5 markers together is unable to distinguish between IPF, N-IPF, and IPAF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some cases of idiopathic fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (f-NSIP) show a progressive course that is similar to that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, it is difficult to predict poor patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether serial changes in serum levels of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein-D (SP-D) can predict disease progression., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 75 patients with idiopathic f-NSIP. Disease behavior was categorized into two groups depending on long-term change of pulmonary function: progressive type (>=5%/year relative decline in the slope of forced vital capacity [FVC] and/or >=7.5%/year relative decline in the slope of %diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [%DLCO]) and stable type. Levels of KL-6 and SP-D and results of pulmonary function tests, which were performed parallelly, were reviewed and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model., RESULTS: The study subjects comprised 62 patients with stable type and 13 patients with progressive type disease behavior. Among these subjects, 50 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Serum levels of both KL-6 and SP-D at baseline showed a negative correlation with %DLCO, but not with FVC, and these biomarkers were not related to disease progression. Persistently high levels of KL-6 and SP-D correlated with progressive type disease behavior in idiopathic (non-IPAF) f-NSIP., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in serum KL-6 and SP-D levels over time may provide useful predictive information on disease behavior during treatment in patients with idiopathic f-NSIP and especially in those with non-IPAF f-NSIP.

AB  - Interstitial pneumonia is a common and major comorbidity affecting the prognosis of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, there are few reported cases of SSc-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) overlap-associated interstitial pneumonia. We herein report a case in which the clinical behavior and histopathology of interstitial pneumonia with SSc-RA overlap syndrome was followed over a long clinical course. When clinicians are deciding on the treatment strategy for patients with SSc-RA overlap syndrome-associated interstitial pneumonia, a pathological examination of a surgical lung biopsy may be useful.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) has heterogeneous characteristics in terms of background, disease behaviour and prognosis. This study of fibrotic NSIP (f-NSIP) aimed to elucidate prognosis and disease behaviour from the viewpoint of clinical background and determine whether long-term change of pulmonary function could provide useful prognostic information., METHODS: We analysed the medical records of 157 consecutive patients diagnosed with f-NSIP by surgical lung biopsy. Disease behaviour was categorized into two groups depending on long-term change of pulmonary function: progressive type (relative >=5%/year decline in the slope of forced vital capacity and/or relative >=7.5%/year decline in the slope of %diffusing capacity of lung carbon monoxide) or stable type. Predictors of disease behaviour and prognosis were determined using logistic and Cox regression models., RESULTS: Our f-NSIP cohort included interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) (36.9%), idiopathic (non-IPAF) (22.3%) and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (40.8%). Multivariate analysis showed that idiopathic (non-IPAF) f-NSIP and progressive type disease were negative prognostic factors of mortality. Poor treatment response at 1 year was an independent predictor of progressive type disease, but was not related to survival. In terms of disease behaviour based on pulmonary function change, some patients with IPAF f-NSIP showed a progressive course., CONCLUSION: Although an IPAF diagnosis was useful for identifying good prognosis in idiopathic f-NSIP, some idiopathic f-NSIP patients with or without IPAF showed progressive disease despite therapy. The definition of progressive type disease may be useful in clinical decision-making when determining therapy for f-NSIP. Copyright © 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.
