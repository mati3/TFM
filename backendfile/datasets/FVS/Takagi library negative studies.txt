AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of preoperative general condition to predict postoperative outcomes is important, particularly in older patients who typically suffer from various comorbidities and exhibit impaired functional status. In addition to various indices such as Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), National Institute on Aging and National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index (NIA/NCI), Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27), and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification (ASA-PS), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is recently gaining attention as a tool to evaluate the general condition of patients from a nutritional perspective. However, the utility of these indices in older patients with colorectal cancer has not been compared., METHODS: The study population comprised 830 patients with Stage I - IV colorectal cancer aged 75 years or older who underwent surgery at the National Cancer Center Hospital from January 2000 to December 2014. Associations of each index with overall survival (OS) (long-term outcome) and postoperative complications (short-term outcome) were examined., RESULTS: For the three indices with the highest Akaike information criterion values (i.e., CONUT score, CCI and ACE-27), but not the remaining indices (NIA/NCI and ASA-PS), OS significantly worsened as general condition scores decreased, after adjusting for known prognostic factors. In contrast, for postoperative complications, only CONUT score was identified as a predictive factor (>=4 versus 0-3; odds ratio: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.13-3.13; P = 0.016)., CONCLUSION: For older patients with colorectal cancer, only CONUT score was a predictive factor of both long-term and short-term outcomes after surgery, suggesting that CONUT score is a useful preoperative risk assessment index.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score for preoperative nutritional assessment has been reported in resected colorectal and esophageal cancer, but not in lung cancer with obstructive lung disease., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 109 patients with adenocarcinoma with obstructive pulmonary disease. We set 1 as the cut-off value for the CONUT score and classified patients into high (>=1) and low (0) CONUT groups., RESULTS: Among 109 patients, 35 (32.1%) had low CONUT scores, and 74 (67.8%) had high CONUT scores. The high-CONUT group was significantly associated with a lower body mass index (p=0.025) and wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status (p=0.011). A multivariate analysis showed that the CONUT score was independently associated with disease-free and overall survival., CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the CONUT score was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma with obstructive lung disease.

AB  - Recent development of tuberculosis in Japan tends to converge on a specific high risk group. The proportion of tuberculosis developing particularly from the compromised hosts in the high risk group is especially high. At this symposium, therefore, we took up diabetes mellitus, gastrectomy, dialysis, AIDS and the elderly for discussion. Many new findings and useful reports for practical medical treatment are submitted; why these compromised hosts are predisposed to tuberculosis, tuberculosis diagnostic and remedial notes of those compromised hosts etc. It is an important question for the future to study how to prevent tuberculosis from these compromised hosts. 1. Tuberculosis in diabetes mellitus: aggravation and its immunological mechanism: Kazuyoshi KAWAKAMI (Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus). It has been well documented that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major aggravating factor in tuberculosis. The onset of this disease is more frequent in DM patients than in individuals with any underlying diseases. However, the precise mechanism of this finding remains to be fully understood. Earlier studies reported that the migration, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of neutrophils are all impaired in DM patients, which is related to their reduced host defense to infection with extracellular bacteria, such as S. aureus and E. colli. Host defense to mycobacterial infection is largely mediated by cellular immunity, and Th1-related cytokines, such as IFN-gamma and IL-12, play a central role in this response. It is reported that serum level of these cytokines and their production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are reduced in tuberculosis patients with DM, and this is supposed to be involved in the high incidence of tuberculosis in DM. Our study observed similar findings and furthermore indicated that IFN-gamma and IL-12 production by BCG-stimulated PBMC was lower in poorly-controlled DM patients than that in well-controlled DM patients and healthy subjects. Thus, these clinical data suggest that the high incidence of tuberculosis in DM patients is due to the impaired production of Th1-related cytokines. However, direct evidences to prove this possibility remain to be obtained. In 1980, Saiki and co-workers reported that host defense and delayed-type hypersensitivity response to M. tuberculosis was hampered in a mouse DM model established by injecting streptozotocin (Infect Immun. 1980; 28: 127-131). We followed their investigation with the similar observations. Interestingly, levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in serum, lung, liver and spleen after infection were significantly reduced in DM mice when compared with those in control mice. Considered collectively, these results strongly suggest that the reduced production of Th1-related cytokines leads to the susceptibility of DM to mycobacterial infection. However, it remains to be understood how DM hampers the synthesis of Th1-related cytokines. In our preliminary study, the production of these cytokines by PBMC from DM patients and healthy subjects was not affected under a high glucose condition. Thus, it is not likely that the increased level of glucose directly suppresses the cell-mediated immune responses. Further investigations are needed to make these points clear. 2. A study of gastrectomy cases in pulmonary tuberculosis patients: Takenori YAGI (Division of Thoracic Disease, National Chiba-Higashi Hospital). Patients who have undergone gastric resection are considered at increased risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis. I have investigated the role played by gastrectomy in giving rise to pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 654 pulmonary tuberculosis patients admitted to National Chiba-Higashi Hospital from January 1999 to December 2001, 55 patients (31-84 years old, mean 63.5 +/- 12.5 years, 48 males and 7 females) had the history of gastric resection. The incidence of gastrectomy among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was 8.4 percent. The mean age of gastric rese tion was 50.2 +/- 16.6 years, and the mean interval from gastrectomy to pulmonary tuberculosis was 13.6 +/- 11.0 years. On admission to our hospital, 34 out of 55 cases were smear positive by sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli and 39 cases had cavitary lesions on chest X-ray. Gastrectomy was done due to carcinoma of the stomach in 31 cases, gastric and/or duodenal ulcer in 21 cases, adenomatous polyp in two cases, and accidental injury in one case. 52 patients improved, but three cases died due to pulmonary tuberculosis. No one had recurrence of carcinoma of the stomach. Body weight, Body Mass Index, Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI; 10x serum albumin concentration +0.005 x peripheral lymphocyte count) which was proposed by Onodera, serum albumin level and serum total cholesterol level were lower in the gastrectomy group than in the non-gastrectomy group. I calculated the odds of tuberculosis among gastrectomy patients to be 3.8 times that of appropriate controls. This study confirms that gastrectomy is one of the risk factor(s) of tuberculosis. However, whether gastrectomy in itself is a risk factor or whether it is secondarily associated with another risk factor such as underweight status and/or inadequate nutrition following surgery remains unclear. 3. Immunodefficiency and tuberculosis in dialysis patients: Hajime INAMOTO (Division of Dialysis, Keio University School of Medicine). The patients who have renal insufficiency is fatal, but they can live much longer by dialysis. The number of lymphocytes of the patients whose serum creatinine was 10 mg/dl or more has decreased to about 50% of the people who have normal kidney. When the lymphocyte was cultured after it was stimulated with PHA, the DNA synthesis of the patients' lymphocyte was much lower than that of the modest people's. In the dialysis food, the nutrient such as vitamins, minerals, etc. were lacked. The density of the serum albumin of the dialysis patient has decreased. Many of them were thin when their BMI was examined. The size of the patients' erythema by the tuberculin test has become small. There were many patients receiving dialysis with erythema but no induration. It means that the delayed skin reaction specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis has decreased among the dialysis patients. The morbidity rate, the mortality rate and the prevalence of tuberculosis was much higher than the general population. The anamnesis of tuberculosis was also high. Most of those tuberculosis patients appear the disease from the period immediately before the beginning of dialysis to one year after that. That is also the period that patients' number of peripheral blood lymphocyte decreased and the tuberculin reaction positivity rate fell sharply. During the dialysis patients, pulmonary tuberculosis with cavities was minority and extrapulmonary tuberculosis and miliary tuberculosis were remarkably many. People with large reaction against the tuberculin test were better prognosis than those with smaller reaction. It was thought that anorexia, weakening, and a weight decrease were seen when the immunity decreased. At the end stage of renal failure, kidney shrink, vitamin D activation becomes difficult, and the low calcium blood syndrome appears. The calcification of tuberculoma is absorbed, soft tuberculoma becomes baring, the caseation abscess melts, and the endogenous infection occurs. The cell immunity has decreased, and tuberculosis attacks. It might be such circumstances that tuberculosis happen frequently at the dialysis introduction period. There are a lot of cases that the caseation necrosis is a little, and the formation of tuberculoma is bad in the pathology opinion. Due to the decrease in the cell immunity, cavities are not formed easily. It is easy to stay in the leaching lesion so that anti-tuberculosis drugs are much effective, and the patients recover easily. However, if the treatment is delayed, it is fatally because hematogenous metastasis are easy to occur and become miliary tuberculosis. 4. AIDS and tuberculosis: Hideaki NAGAI (Department of Respira ory Diseases, National Tokyo Hospital). With AIDS patients with tuberculosis, there are the following problems on the treatment. (1) The adverse reactions by antituberculosis drugs tend to occur in AIDS patients. Eleven of 33 AIDS patients with tuberculosis had the adverse reactions (skin rash, fever, liver dysfunction) considered to be due to antituberculosis drugs. It is a very large burden for the HIV infected persons to take simultaneously antituberculosis drugs, medicines for opportunistic infections, and anti-HIV medicines. Since many medicines are taken, it is difficult to determine which drug is the cause once an adverse reaction occurs and all medicines should be often stopped. (2) The combined use with rifampicin (RFP) is difficult for the protease inhibitors and nonnuclear acid reverse transcriptase inhibitors. RFP induces cytochrome P-450 in liver, accelerates the metabolism of some concomitant drug agents, and reduces blood concentration them remarkably. When starting the two above-mentioned medicines during tuberculosis treatment, RFP should be changed to rifabutin (RFB) which has less induction of P-450 than RFP. However, some procedures are required for acquisition of RFB and it is a little complicated in Japan. CDC mentioned the combined use with RFP and efavirenz (EFV) is possible. So, the treatment with EFV and RFP is recently chosen. However, the monitor of the blood concentration of EFV is required, and the dose of EFV should be increased if it is a low value. (3) When a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is given to AIDS patients with tuberculosis, transient worsening of tuberculosis may develop after about two weeks. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

AB  - Predicting the prognosis of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is useful in determining the appropriate management strategy. The present study aimed to investigate the association between PDAC prognosis and inflammation-based markers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index, modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) and controlling nutritional status score. A total of 72 patients with unresectable PDAC who received chemotherapy were included. Inflammation-based markers were measured prior to treatment. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 117 days (range, 10-781 days) and 244 days (range 43-781 days), respectively. The cut-off value of continuous variables that predicted the median OS (244 days) was calcualted. Univariate analysis of PFS showed that disease stage, first-line chemotherapy regimen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mGPS and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) scores were associated with PFS. Among them, stage, first-line chemotherapy regimen, CEA, NLR and mGPS were independent prognostic factors for PFS in multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis of OS showed that stage, first-line chemotherapy regimen, CA19-9, NLR, PLR, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), mGPS and CONUT score were associated wtih OS. Among them, first-line chemotherapy and mGPS were independent prognostic factors for OS according to multivariate analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a NLR >=4.0 and mGPS 2 were independent prognostic factors for PFS. For OS, mGPS 2 was an independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, mGPS was the most useful marker in predicting the prognosis of patients with unresectable PDAC who received chemotherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pneumonia is the second-most common complication in postoperative patients and is associated with significant morbidity and high costs of care. We aimed to determine the risk factors for pneumonia after general and digestive surgery., METHODS: The medical records of 1,016 patients who underwent general and digestive surgery between January 2016 and March 2019 in our hospital were reviewed., RESULTS: Of the 1,016 patients, 67 (6.6%) developed postoperative pneumonia. The multivariate analysis showed that significant predictors of postoperative pneumonia were a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), low forced vital capacity and low forced expiratory volume in one second in the spirometry test, malnutrition (low serum albumin levels and low controlling nutritional status scores and prognostic nutritional index [PNI] values), esophagectomy, upper gastrointestinal surgery, and nonlaparoscopic surgery. Of these factors, the combination of PNI and ECOG-PS clearly stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with respect to developing postoperative pneumonia (area under the curve: 0.709)., CONCLUSIONS: Although postoperative pneumonia is associated with many clinical variables, active medical intervention for the prevention of pneumonia in patients with multiple risk factors can improve the postoperative course. In particular, perioperative nutritional care may prevent postoperative pneumonia in patients with malnutrition and a poor PS.

AB  - The relationship between skeletal muscle volume and the prognosis of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains undetermined. We conducted a retrospective study of 72 IBD patients who were admitted to the hospital due to disease exacerbation. We enrolled IBD patients who had undergone abdominal computed tomography and assessed the nutritional indices, such as the Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (O-PNI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) index. The L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI), which is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscles at the level of the third lumbar (L3) vertebra to the height squared, was used to identify sarcopenia. Sarcopenia, defined as a low SMI, was observed in 42% of all IBD patients (37% with Crohn's disease (CD) and 48% with ulcerative colitis (UC)). In UC patients, the O-PNI and CONUT values, height, and albumin levels were significantly lower than in CD patients. The SMI strongly correlated with sex, body weight, albumin level, and O-PNI in IBD patients. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model demonstrated that the presence of sarcopenia (P = 0.015) and disease type (CD or UC) (P = 0.007) were significant factors predicting intestinal resection. The cumulative operation-free survival rate was significantly lower for sarcopenic patients than in all IBD patients (P = 0.003) and a stratified analysis of CD patients (P = 0.001) using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The L3 skeletal muscle area is a prognostic factor for intestinal resection in patients with CD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the prognostic significance of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) in patients with BCLC stage A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2013 to December 2016, 325 patients with BCLC stage A HCC who underwent RFA at the National Cancer Center and First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into low (<= 4) and high (>= 5) CONUT scores for assessment of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Several covariates, including age, sex, the diameter and number of lesions, lesion differentiation, Child-Pugh class, hepatitis B virus infection, along with blood levels of AFP, AST, ALT, gamma-GT, and TBIL, were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses., RESULTS: The mortality rate was 17.49% (46/263) and 35.48% (22/62) in the low and high CONUT groups, respectively, with the difference being statistically significant (P = 0.033). In addition, disease recurrence was significantly higher in the high CONUT group at 70.97%, as compared to the low CONUT group at 43.35% (P = 0.041). The predictive factors were used to build the nomogram to estimate 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and RFS rates., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT scores were found to be associated with the prognosis of patients with early-stage HCC who underwent RFA. Higher CONUT scores were associated with poor survival outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proximal gastrectomy offers theoretical benefits over total gastrectomy in terms of hematologic and nutritional outcomes. However, little evidence confirming these benefits has been reported. The aim of this study was to assess the hematologic and nutritional outcomes of proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction in comparison to those of total gastrectomy., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 80 patients with stage I gastric cancer who underwent proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (n = 38) or total gastrectomy (n = 42) from September 2014 to December 2015. We compared hematologic (including hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin B12, etc.) and nutritional outcomes [including body mass index (BMI), serum total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, and total lymphocyte count] between the two groups., RESULTS: We found no significant differences in changes in hemoglobin (P = 0.250) or cumulative incidence of iron deficiency anemia (P = 0.971) during a median follow-up period of 24 months (range 18-30 months) after surgery. Cumulative incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency also did not differ significantly between the proximal and total gastrectomy groups (P = 0.087). BMI changes from baseline were not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.591). Likewise, there were no statistically significant differences in nutritional outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction exhibited similar outcomes in terms of hematologic and nutritional features in comparison to total gastrectomy.

AB  - We mainly aimed to preliminarily explore the prognostic values of nutrition-based prognostic scores in patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA). We retrospectively analyzed 73 cases of HCCA, who underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary stenting (PTBS) combined with I seed intracavitary irradiation from November 2012 to April 2017 in our department. The postoperative changes of total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin (ALB) were observed. The preoperative clinical data were collected to calculate the nutrition-based scores, including controlling nutritional status (CONUT), C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression model were used for overall survival (OS) analyses. The serum levels of TBIL, DBIL, ALT, AST, and ALP significantly reduced, and ALB significantly increased at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The median survival time of the cohort was 12 months and the 1-year survival rate was 53.1%. Univariate analysis revealed that the statistically significant factors related to OS were CA19-9, TBIL, ALB, CONUT, and PNI. Multivariate analysis further identified CA19-9, CONUT, and PNI as independent prognostic factors.Nutrition-based prognostic scores, CONUT and PNI in particular, can be used as predictors of survival in unresectable HCCA.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is a useful nutritional evaluation, that is calculated from serum albumin, total cholesterol concentrations, and total lymphocyte count. This study aimed to investigate the association between the CONUT score and prognosis in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CONUT score was retrospectively calculated in 211 patients with mCRC receiving first-line chemotherapy. The patients were divided into three groups: the CONUT low-group (0-1), intermediate-group (2-4), and high-group (5-). The associations of the CONUT score with clinicopathological factors and survival outcomes were evaluated., RESULTS: The higher CONUT score was significantly associated with synchronous metastases, and no primary tumor resection. The higher CONUT score group showed a significant shorter progression-free survival (log-rank p<0.05) and overall survival (log-rank p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: The CONUT score is a useful prognostic marker for predicting survival outcomes of patients with mCRC.

AB  - Lenvatinib was recently approved as a novel first-line molecular targeted agent (MTA) for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The importance of relative dose intensity (RDI) has been shown in the treatment of various types of cancers. However, RDI may not accurately reflect the treatment intensity of lenvatinib, as it is the first oral MTA where the dose is based on the patient's weight. We aimed to evaluate the utility of 2M-DBR (the delivered dose intensity/body surface area ratio at 60 days) by comparing the relationship between 2M-DBR, 2M-RDI (RDI at 60 days), and the therapeutic response. The therapeutic response to lenvatinib was evaluated in 45 patients who underwent computed tomography 8-12 weeks after treatment initiation. We also investigated the clinical factors associated with high 2M-DBR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic of 2M-DBR that predicts the response to lenvatinib was higher than that of 2M-RDI (0.8004 vs. 0.7778). Patients with high 2M-DBR achieved significantly better objective responses and disease control rates than those with low 2M-DBR (p < 0.0001 and 0.0008). Patients with high 2M-DBR experienced significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those with low 2M-DBR (p = 0.0001), while there was no significant correlation between 2M-RDI levels and PFS (p = 0.2198). Patients who achieved higher levels of 2M-DBR had a significantly better modified ALBI grade (p = 0.0437), better CONUT score (p = 0.0222), and higher BTR (p = 0.0281). Multivariate analysis revealed that high 2M-DBR was the only significant factor associated with longer PFS. In conclusion, 2M-DBR could be an important factor that reflects treatment intensity and useful for predicting the response to lenvatinib against HCC, instead of 2M-RDI.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) was recently identified as a serum glycobiomarker for liver fibrosis. However, the relationship between M2BPGi and malnutrition in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate whether M2BPGi could be a surrogate marker for malnutrition in patients with CLD., METHODS: In total, 338 outpatients with CLD were enrolled (median age: 67 years). We evaluated the associations among liver fibrosis markers (M2BPGi, fibrosis-4 index, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet count ratio index), Child-Pugh stages, and nutritional status markers., RESULTS: The median value (range) of serum M2BPGi levels was 0.94 cut-off index (COI) (0.22-11.57) in chronic hepatitis and Child-Pugh A (n = 274), 4.775 COI (1.32-16.68) in Child-Pugh B (n = 46), and 11.37 COI (6.03-18.33) in Child-Pugh C (n = 18) (overall significance, P < 0.001). Serum M2BPGi levels showed a strong correlation with serum albumin concentration and controlling nutritional status score (rs = -0.649, P < 0.001 and rs = 0.671, P < 0.001, respectively). The correlations between M2BPGi and nutritional status markers were especially high in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and non-B non-C hepatitis and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the three fibrosis markers, M2BPGi yielded the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.920) for predicting hypoalbuminemia at an optimal cut-off value of 2.41 (sensitivity, 87.3%; specificity, 87.6%; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum M2BPGi levels are correlated with nutritional status markers in patients with CLD and could be a useful clinical marker of malnutrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Malnutrition appears to be a major and noticeable problem for hospitalized patients and often present in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. This study attempts to evaluate differences in nutritional status parameters and nutritional state differences among hospitalized patients with various gastrointestinal diseases and disorders., METHODOLOGY: Our study included 154 males and 146 females, aged 18-84 years old, with various gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. All patients underwent baseline nutritional assessment, including subjective global assessment (SGA), anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and biochemical markers., RESULTS: Prevalence of malnutrition was 45.7%. The highest prevalence was detected among patients suffering from gastrointestinal malignancies and chronic pancreatitis. All parameters decreased with malnourishment levels, except CRP and in-hospital stay which rose with malnourishment grade. SGA and length of hospital stay negatively correlated with all analyzed variables of nutritional assessment, except CRP., CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from gastrointestinal malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease and peptic ulcer disease have more pronounced level of malnutrition. Body mass index, triceps skin fold thickness, mid-arm circumference, MAMC, wrist circumference, total protein level, albumin, cholesterol, glucose level, lymphocyte count, basal metabolic rate, body fat mass, fat free mass, muscle mass, total body water and resistance appeared to be inversely correlated with malnutrition. However, CRP level correlated positively with the malnutrition severity. SGA malnutrition level is dependent of hospitalization length.

AB  - PURPOSE: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are becoming the standard of care in many surgical procedures, although data on their use following hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new ERAS pathway in terms of the patient nutrition status after hepatectomy for HCC., METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 97 consecutive patients treated with open or laparoscopic hepatectomy for HCC between January 2011 and August 2014. We compared the perioperative outcomes between patients whose treatment incorporated the ERAS pathway and control patients. The nutritional status was evaluated using the controlling nutritional status score., RESULTS: The length of hospital stay (LOS) after both open and laparoscopic hepatectomy was shorter for the ERAS group than the control group. The days of ambulation and cessation of intravenous infusion were earlier and the postoperative nutrition status was statistically better in the ERAS group than in the control group. A multivariate analysis showed that being in the non-ERAS group was a risk factor of delayed discharge. There were no marked differences in the rate of severe complications between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The ERAS pathway seems feasible and safe and results in a faster recovery, reduced LOS, improved nutrition status, and fewer severe complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether objective evaluation by using the palliative prognostic index(PPI), controlling nutritional status(COUNT), and prognostic nutritional index(PNI)can provide prognostic information during the transition from chemotherapy to palliative care in patients with advanced or recurrent gastrointestinal cancer., METHODS: The subjects were 28 patients with gastrointestinal cancer who died of their disease between January 2009 and June 2012. We compared the PPI, COUNT, and PNI scores between patients who died within 90 days of completing chemotherapy(Group A, n=14)and patients who survived for 90 or more days(Group B, n=14)., RESULTS: The PPI score for Group A(4.0)was significantly higher than that for Group B(0.8)(p<0.001). The COUNT score was also significantly higher for Group A(6.3)than for Group B (3.9)(p=0.033). A significant difference in survival was evident when the cutoff value for PNI was set at 40 in the critical region(68/118, p=0.04)., CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the PPI, COUNT, and PNI may be useful for objective evaluation during the transition from chemotherapy to palliative care.

AB  - PURPOSE: Oncological outcome depends not only on tumor behaviour but also on nutritional and immune-inflammatory host status. Data in gastric cancer are limited. The main aim of this study was to prospectively assess Naples prognostic score (NPS) in gastric cancer patients. NPS was also compared with prognostic nutritional index (PNI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and systemic inflammation score (SIS)., METHODS: Overall survival (OS) and complication rates of 415 patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery from January 2000 to December 2015 were calculated. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates were assessed in 307 radically resected patients. MaxStat analysis was used to identify the best cut-off values. NPS scores were divided into 3 groups (NPS 0-3). The receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve for censored survival data was used to compare the prognostic performance of scoring systems., RESULTS: NPS positively correlated with current scoring systems (p<0.001) and advanced tumor stages (p<0.001). Patients with elevated NPS scores experienced more postoperative complications (all patients: p=0.003; radically resected patients: p=0.010). NPS1 and NPS2 patients had a higher hazard ratio (HR) than NPS0 patients for OS (NPS1 HR 2.04, NPS2 HR 4.27; p<0.001) and DFS (NPS1 HR 1.70, NPS2 HR 4.98; p<0.001). Among the different scoring systems, only NPS was selected as an independent significant predictor for OS (p=0.024) and DFS (p=0.009). NPS was assigned the best prognostic performance by ROC analysis, equalling TNM staging system, and correctly identified highrisk patients., CONCLUSIONS: NPS is an easy to calculate prognostic score strongly associated with outcome in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery., KEY WORDS: Gastric cancers, Immune-nutritional and inflammatory host status, Naples prognostic score.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The existing scores reflecting the patient's nutritional and inflammatory status do not include all biomarkers and have been poorly studied in colorectal cancers., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess a new prognostic tool, the Naples prognostic score, comparing it with the prognostic nutritional index, controlling nutritional status score, and systemic inflammation score., DESIGN: This was an analysis of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer., SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a university hospital., PATIENTS: A total of 562 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in July 2004 through June 2014 and 468 patients undergoing potentially curative surgery were included. MaxStat analysis dichotomized neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte:monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index, and the controlling nutritional status score. The Naples prognostic scores were divided into 3 groups (group 0, 1, and 2). The receiver operating characteristic curve for censored survival data compared the prognostic performance of the scoring systems., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival and complication rates in all patients, as well as recurrence and disease-free survival rates in radically resected patients, were measured., RESULTS: The Naples prognostic score correlated positively with the other scoring systems (p < 0.001) and worsened with advanced tumor stages (p < 0.001). Patients with the worst Naples prognostic score experienced more postoperative complications (all patients, p = 0.010; radically resected patients, p = 0.026). Compared with group 0, patients in groups 1 and 2 had worse overall (group 1, HR = 2.90; group 2, HR = 8.01; p < 0.001) and disease-free survival rates (group 1, HR = 2.57; group 2, HR = 6.95; p < 0.001). Only the Naples prognostic score was an independent significant predictor of overall (HR = 2.0; p = 0.03) and disease-free survival rates (HR = 2.6; p = 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the Naples prognostic score had the best prognostic performance and discriminatory power for overall (p = 0.02) and disease-free survival (p = 0.04)., LIMITATIONS: This is a single-center study, and its validity needs additional external validation., CONCLUSIONS: The Naples prognostic score is a simple tool strongly associated with long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to determine the extent of malnutrition in patients waiting for a liver transplant. The agreement among the methods of nutritional assessment and their diagnostic validity were evaluated., METHODS: Patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation (n = 110) were studied. The variables were: body mass index, analytical parameters, liver disease etiology, and complications. Liver dysfunction was evaluated using the Child-Pugh Scale. Nutritional state was studied using the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), the Spanish Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (SENPE) criteria, the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI-O), and the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). Agreement was determined using the Kappa index. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUCs), the Youden index (J), and likelihood ratios were computed., RESULTS: Malnutrition varied depending on the method of evaluation. The highest value was detected using the CONUT (90.9%) and the lowest using the SGA (50.9%). The pairwise agreement among the methods ranged from K = 0.041 to K = 0.826, with an overall agreement of each criteria with the remaining methods between K = 0.093 and K = 0.364. PNI-O was the method with the highest overall agreement. Taking this level of agreement into account, we chose the PNI-O as a benchmark method of comparison. The highest positive likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of malnutrition was obtained from the Nutritional Risk Index (13.56)., CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition prevalence is high and prevalence estimates vary according the method used, with low concordance among methods. PNI-O and NRI are the most consistent methods to identify malnutrition in these patients. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is associated with increased morbimortality in liver transplant patients, and it is important to identify factors related to nutritional status in these patients., AIMS: Determine variables associated with malnutrition and create a nomogram in liver transplant candidates., METHODS: Cross-sectional study (n = 110)., VARIABLES: demographic variables, imbalances due to the disease, transplant aetiology and analytical parameters. Physical examination was performed and degree of hepatic dysfunction calculated. Nutritional status was assessed: Controlling Nutritional Status, Spanish Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition criteria, Nutritional Risk Index, Prognostic Nutritional Index or Onodera Index and The Subjective Global Assessment. Logistic regression analysis was performed. A predictive nomogram (discrimination and calibration analysis) was generated., RESULTS: Malnourishment was defined according to at least 4 or more of the methods studied. Patients with ascites, encephalopathy and portal hypertension presented malnourishment more frequently. Malnutrition was associated with greater liver dysfunction and lower grip strength. Variables independently associated with malnourishment were encephalopathy and lower albumin values. A nomogram was created to predict malnourishment, with good discriminatory power and calibration., CONCLUSIONS: A score was developed for evaluating malnutrition risk. This would provide a tool that makes it possible to quickly and easily identify the risk of malnutrition in liver transplant candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas are rare pancreatic neoplasms where complete resection is the cornerstone in management. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that minimally invasive surgical approaches are effective management options in treating SPNs of the distal pancreas. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery in treating SPNs of the uncinate, head, and neck of the pancreas., METHODS: Data from 2005 to 2017 at Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health systems in Seoul, South Korea, were retrospectively collected for 25 patients who were diagnosed with SPN of the uncinate, head, and neck of the pancreas and who underwent curative resection. Three groups of patients were considered, depending on the year of surgery, in order to determine trends in the surgical management of SPN. The patients were also divided into two groups corresponding to the type of operation done (minimally invasive surgery vs. open surgery). Perioperative patient data, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, and operation done, were compared and analyzed statistically. Long-term nutritional effects were measured using the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) scoring system., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, BMI, symptomatic presentation, operation type, tumor size, and tumor stage between the three time periods. In comparing between minimally invasive and open surgery, there were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, symptomatic presentation, BMI, tumor size, preoperative stage, type of operation, operation time, pancreatic duct size, post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grade, death associated with disease, recurrence, pathological parameters, and change in CONUT score. There was a significant difference in tumor size (4.5 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.0 cm, p = 0.004), blood loss (664.2 +/- 512.4 vs. 277.7 +/- 250.8 mL, p = 0.024), need to transfuse (33% vs. 0%, p = 0.023), hospital length of stay (27.4 +/- 15.3 vs. 11.5 +/- 5.3 days, p = 0.002), and complication rate (75% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.027) between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients with SPNs of the uncinate, head, and neck of the pancreas, a minimally invasive surgical approach offers at least equal oncologic and nutritional outcomes, while demonstrating decreased complications and decreased hospital length of stay compared with that of an open surgical approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Recently, skeletal muscle quality was important in patients with malignant tumors to predict the surgical outcome. The relationship between postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade III or more and prognosis in patients who have undergone hepatic resection for hepatic malignancies were investigated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient data were retrospectively collected for 146 consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection in the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Gunma University, Japan, for hepatic malignancy. The patients were assigned to two groups according to the presence of postoperative complications. The clinicopathological and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) and intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) were also evaluated., RESULTS: No hospital deaths occurred. Postoperative complications were identified in 12 patients (8.2%). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the independent risk factors for postoperative complications were hemodialysis, psychiatric disorder, high CONUT (controlling nutritional status) score and patients both with low SMA and high IMAC., CONCLUSION: Intensive surgical care is necessary for high-risk patients with hemodialysis, psychiatric disorder, high CONUT count and/or low skeletal muscle quality to reduce postoperative complication.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The occurrence of hepatic steatosis after pancreatectomy is known to be associated with the remnant pancreatic function. However, other risk factors for hepatic steatosis after pancreatectomy remain unknown. The aims of this study were to identify other risk factors in addition to the remnant pancreatic function and elucidate the relationship between postoperative hepatic steatosis and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in totally pancreatomized patients., METHODS: Forty-three patients who underwent total pancreatectomy were analyzed. Hepatic steatosis was defined as the attenuation of unenhanced computed tomography values. Clinical findings and laboratory data were compared between patients with and without hepatic steatosis., RESULTS: Sixteen (37.2%) patients developed hepatic steatosis after total pancreatectomy, with marked declines in the Controlling Nutritional Status score and body mass index. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the attenuation of computed tomography values was correlated with female sex (P = 0.002), early postoperative serum albumin levels (P = 0.003), and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy with high-dose pancrelipase (P = 0.032)., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative hepatic steatosis after pancreatectomy is associated with sex, malnutrition, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. High-dose pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy may have preventive effects on hepatic steatosis occurring after pancreatectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown a variety of nutritional indices to be prognostic predictors for esophageal cancer patients. However, which nutritional index should be used and when it should be measured during the perioperative period remain unclear. This study attempted to clarify the details surrounding predictive nutritional evaluation by assessing the longitudinal data of serologic indices in perioperative esophageal cancer patients., METHODS: The study included 141 esophageal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy after radical esophagectomy at Tohoku University Hospital from April 2008 to December 2017. The nutritional status was retrospectively assessed during the perioperative period, and the prognostic factors related to survival were analyzed., RESULTS: Use of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score showed that malnutrition occurred only from 14 days after surgery in most cases. Use of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) showed that the ratio of malnutrition increased gradually from presurgery to 14 days after surgery. The timing of malnutrition that affected survival was 14 days after surgery with the CONUT score and presurgery and 4 months after surgery with the PNI. A multivariable analysis of independent prognostic factors predicting survival identified malnutrition 14 days after surgery with the CONUT score and a low PNI before surgery, invasion depth of the primary lesion, and node metastasis., CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition occurring during the perioperative state of esophageal cancer was shown to be a survival prognostic factor. Development of an optimal nutritional intervention is recommended for esophageal cancer patients to prevent malnutrition both before and after surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent improvements in early detection, progress in surgical techniques, and development of chemoradiation therapies, prognosis of esophageal cancer remains poor. The aim of the present study was to assess whether Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), an inflammation-based prognostic score, has prognostic value independent of conventional clinicopathological criteria in patients undergoing curative resection for esophageal cancer, even in elderly patients., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the database of 141 consecutive patients with histologically verified esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery in our institute, between January 2006 and December 2014. GPS and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated., RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, TNM stage (p < 0.0001) and GPS (p = 0.041) were independently associated with worse prognosis in overall patients with esophageal cancer. Multivariate analysis evaluated the prognostic factors in two different patient groups: patients younger than 70 years (non-elderly) and those aged 70 years or more (elderly). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TNM stage (p = 0.0003) was an only independent risk factor for a worse prognosis among non-elderly group. Meanwhile, multivariate analysis demonstrated that TNM stage (p = 0.001) and GPS (p = 0.043) were the independent risk factor for a worse prognosis among elderly group., CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that GPS is associated with prognosis and can be considered as an independent prognostic marker in patients who underwent esophagectomy. Moreover, the GPS has the advantage of being simple to measure, routinely available and well standardized. But the present study failed to confirm the NLR as a significant predictor of survival following resection for esophageal cancer. Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

AB  - It is now clear that cancer survival is determined not only by tumor pathology but also by host-related factors, in particular, nutritional status and systemic inflammation. It is desirable that the essential properties of any scale designed or intended to be used for the prediction of survival are simple, convenient, and objective. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the database of patients who underwent curative surgery for esophageal cancer in our department to evaluate controlling nutritional status (CONUT) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as predictors of cancer-specific survival (CSS) after esophagectomy. We retrospectively reviewed the database of 148 consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative surgery for histologically verified esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at our institute between January 2002 and December 2014. CONUT and NLR were calculated. On multivariate analysis, pTNM stage (P < 0.0001) and CONUT (P = 0.0291) were independently associated with worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis evaluated the prognostic factors in 2 different patient groups: patients younger than 70 years (nonelderly) and those aged 70 years or more (elderly). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pTNM stage (P = 0.0083) and CONUT (P = 0.0138) were the independent risk factors for a worse prognosis among the nonelderly group, whereas univariate analysis demonstrated that pTNM stage (P = 0.0002) was the only independent risk factor for a worse prognosis among the elderly group. CONUT was a significant predictor of CSS in patients with esophageal cancer in this study. However, pTNM stage remained a significantly more powerful predictor of CSS. Therefore, the results of this study suggested that CONUT and pTNM stage are the significant and complementary factors predicting survival in patients with esophageal cancer. But, this study failed to confirm the NLR as a significant predictor of CSS after resection for esophageal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, it is not unusual to treat oncologic patients whose tumor markers are within normal range, even with advanced cancer. The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score could provide a useful nutritional and immunological prognostic biomarker for cancer patients. In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of the CONUT score for patients with gastric cancer, including a subgroup analysis with stratification based on serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 368 consecutive patients who underwent curative laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy. The prognostic value of the CONUT score was compared between patients with a low (<= 2) and high (>= 3) score, with propensity score matching (PSM) used to control for biasing covariates (Depth of tumor, Lymph node metastasis, pathological TNM (pTNM) stage)., RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) among all patients was independently predicted by the tumor stage (hazard ratio (HR): 2.231, p = 0.001), the CONUT score (HR: 2.254, p = 0.001), and serum CEA level (HR: 1.821, p = 0.025). Among patients with a normal preoperative serum CEA level, tumor stage (HR: 2.350, p = 0.007), and the CONUT score (HR: 1.990, p = 0.028) were independent prognostic factors of OS. In the high serum CEA level group, tumor size (HR: 2.930, p = 0.015) and the CONUT score (HR: 3.707, p = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors of OS., CONCLUSIONS: It is advantageous to use both CEA level and the CONUT score to assess the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer, which reflect both tumor-related factors and host-related factors, respectively.

AB  - The feasibility of laparoscopic surgery for elderly patients remains unclear, as these patients usually present with comorbidities. Recently, the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score has drawn attention as an evaluation score of patients' general status as well as a predictor of survival. We retrospectively analyzed overall survival in 424 patients aged >=75 years with colon cancer, who underwent curative surgery (laparoscopic (n = 167) or open surgery (n = 257)) between January 2004 and December 2013. To adjust for heterogeneity in both groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed, with the CONUT score as a confounding covariate. 5-year overall survival rates of patients with normal (0-1), mildly abnormal (2-4), or abnormal (>=5) CONUT score were 88.6%, 79.4%, and 41.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). T3 or less, N negative, late period (2009-2013), and normal CONUT score were associated with the tendency to undergo laparoscopic surgery (p < 0.001). The analysis of the propensity score-matched cohort (124 pairs) revealed that patients in the laparoscopic surgery group had a similar prognosis to those in the open surgery group, with a 5-year overall survival of 91.9% vs. 82.0%, respectively (p = 0.102). Laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer is an acceptable surgical approach in elderly patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative paralytic ileus can be a difficult complication for both surgeons and patients. Causes and treatments have been discussed for more than two centuries, but have not yet been fully resolved. Daikenchuto (TJ-100, DKT) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine. Recently, some beneficial mechanisms of DKT to relieve paralytic ileus have been reported. DKT can suppress inflammation, increase intestinal blood flow, and accelerate bowel movements. Therefore, we have designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of DKT on postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy in patients with left-sided colon cancer at a single institution., METHODS/DESIGN: As primary endpoints, the following outcomes will be evaluated: (i) grade of abdominal pain determined using the numeric rating scale (NRS), (ii) grade of abdominal distention determined using the NRS, and (iii) quality of life determined using the Gastrointestinal Quality Life Index (GIQLI). As secondary endpoints, the following will be evaluated: (i) postoperative nutritional status (Onodera's Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and the Controlling Nutritional Status score (CONUT score)), (ii) duration to initial flatus, (iii) duration to initial defecation, (iv) bowel gas volume, (v) character of stool (Bristol Stool Form Scale), (vi) defecation frequency per day, (vii) postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification), (viii) length of postoperative hospital stay, and (ix) metabolites in the stool and blood. This trial is an open-label study, and needs to include 40 patients (20 patients per group) and is expected to span 2 years., DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of DKT on postoperative subjective outcomes (i.e., postoperative quality of life) following laparoscopic colectomy as primary endpoints. Exploratory metabolomics analysis of metabolites in stool and blood will be conducted in this trial, which previously has only been performed in a few human studies. The study aims to guide a future full-scale pragmatic randomized trial to assess the overall effectiveness of DKT to improve the postoperative quality of life following laparoscopic colectomy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR (Japan), UMIN000023318 .

AB  - Purpose: The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is a recently developed measure that is calculated using the serum albumin level, total cholesterol level, and lymphocyte counts. The aim of this study was to examine whether the CONUT score can predict post-operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing curative gastrectomy., Patients and methods: Pre-operative CONUT scores were evaluated from August 2014 to September 2016 in 357 gastric cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo curative gastrectomy. The patients were divided into three groups according to pre-operative CONUT scores: normal, light, moderate, and severe. We then calculated the association between the patient's CONUT score and post-operative complications., Results: CONUT scores were statistically associated with age (P = 0.015), body mass index (P < 0.001), pre-operative hemoglobin level (P < 0.001), tumor-node-metastasis stage (P < 0.001), surgical method (P = 0.036), and post-operative complications (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age and the CONUT score were independent predictors of post-operative complications and 1-year survival., Conclusion: CONUT scores can be used to predict post-operative complications and 1-year survival in elderly gastric cancer patients undergoing curative gastrectomy. They can also be used to classify the nutritional status of patients, which can be helpful for pre-and post-operative nutritional management. Copyright © 2019 Huang et al.

AB  - AIM: There is increasing evidence that inflammation-based prognostic scores are stage-independent predictors of poor outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, these findings were observed in a small-sized study comparing the prognostic value of these scores for patients after curative resection for HCC., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 717 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent curative liver resection at Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital. Clinicopathological variables including preoperative inflammation-based prognostic scores, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, Controlling Nutritional Status score, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and Glasgow Prognostic Score were analyzed. The prognostic value of these scores was compared by the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses., RESULTS: The integrate area under the curve of PNI, Controlling Nutritional Status score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and Glasgow Prognostic Score were 0.6751, 0.6435, 0.5845, 0.5276, and 0.5351 for overall survival (OS), respectively, and 0.5955, 0.5694, 0.4692, 0.4873, and 0.5272 for disease-free survival, respectively. Multivariate analyses for prognosis factor in HCC patients showed that PNI was an independent predictor of both OS (HR 0.91, P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (HR 0.94, P < 0.001). When the patients were divided into high and low PNI groups, the patients in the low PNI group had significant poorer OS (P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (P < 0.001), even after background factors were matched between these two groups., CONCLUSIONS: PNI is superior to Controlling Nutritional Status score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, or Glasgow Prognostic Score as a predictor of OS and recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatic resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the preoperative immune-nutritional status has been reported to correlate with the survival rate in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there have been no reports on the relationship between the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and the clinical outcome after curative surgery for CRC. We herein evaluated the prognostic significance of the CONUT score in patients with CRC, and then compared the accuracy of the CONUT score and the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) as a predictor of survival., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 204 patients who underwent curative surgery for Stage II/III CRC. Patients were divided into two groups according to the CONUT score and the PNI., RESULTS: The five-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate was significantly higher at 92.7% in the low CONUT group, compared to a rate of 81.0% in the high CONUT group (p=0.0016). The five-year CSS was 71.2% in the low PNI group and 92.3% in the high PNI group, which showed a significant difference (p=0.0155). A multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis and the CONUT score were independent risk factors for CSS., CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the CONUT score is a strong independent predictor of the survival among CRC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is a useful tool to evaluate immune-nutritional status. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the CONUT score on short- and long-term outcomes after curative resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)., METHODS: Consecutive 344 PDAC patients receiving pancreatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy were examined retrospectively. After the best predictive value of the CONUT score for survival was identified, association between the CONUT score and long-term outcomes was evaluated using log-rank tests and a Cox regression model. Then correlations between the CONUT score and postoperative complications were analyzed., RESULTS: The optimal cutoff value of the CONUT score was 4. The high CONUT score group showed significantly lower overall survival than the low CONUT score group (P = 0.002). In contrast, no significant difference in recurrence-free survival was found (P = 0.43). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that high CONUT score had an independent association with overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.64; P = 0.003). The CONUT score showed no association with postoperative pancreatic fistula, Clavien-Dindo grade, or postoperative hospital stay., CONCLUSION: The CONUT score had an independent association with survival in patients with PDAC after pancreatectomy and was not associated with recurrence or postoperative complications.

AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the rarely reported long-term nutritional results of patients with gastric cancer after curative gastrectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the prospectively collected medical records of 658 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy with curative intent for gastric cancer from January 2008 to December 2009 and had no recurrences. All patients were followed for 5 years. Nutritional statuses were assessed using measurements of body weight, serum hemoglobin, total lymphocyte count (TLC), protein, albumin, cholesterol, and nutritional risk index (NRI)., RESULTS: Patients who underwent total gastrectomy had lower body weights, hemoglobin, protein, albumin, and cholesterol levels. TLC and NRI valued after the first postoperative year (P<0.05), and lower hemoglobin and NRI valued during the fifth postoperative year than patients who underwent distal gastrectomy (P<0.05). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy had lower hemoglobin, protein, albumin, and cholesterol levels. TLC and NRI valued during the first postoperative year, than those who underwent gastrectomy only (P<0.05). Regarding post-distal gastrectomy reconstruction, those who underwent Roux-en-Y had lower cholesterol levels than did those who underwent Billroth-I and Billroth-II reconstruction at the first and fifth years after gastrectomy, respectively (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing total or distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis or adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery should be monitored carefully for malnutrition during the first postoperative year, and patients undergoing total gastrectomy should be monitored for malnutrition and anemia for 5 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reported our results of endoscopic gastroduodenal stenting for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction., METHODS: This retrospective study investigated cases of malignant gastric and duodenal obstruction treated with gastroduodenal stenting between April 2014 and December 2016., RESULTS: The mean operative time was 34 minutes. The mean time to the first intake of solid food was 2.7 days, and the median time was 3 days. Complications were restenosis, vomiting, anemia, anorexia, and gastric pain. In 8 patients, the GOOSS score was improved. In 5 patients, the CONUT score was improved. In 6 patients, the albumin level was improved. The mean overall survival time was 130 days, and the median time was 112 days., CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that gastroduodenal stenting for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction was minimally invasive and improved quality of life(QOL)in a short time.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of post-operative oral nutrition supplementation after major gastrointestinal surgery., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate 174 subjects who were discharged within 2 weeks after major gastrointestinal surgery. The subjects in the study group were prescribed 400 ml/day of Encover R from the day of discharge for 8 weeks, but no supplementation was allowed in the control group. The primary endpoint was the weight loss rate at 8 weeks after discharge compared with the pre-operative weight, and the secondary endpoints included changes in body weight, body mass index, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment score/grade, hematological/ biochemical parameters, and adverse events evaluated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after discharge., RESULTS: The weight loss rate at 8 weeks after discharge did not differ between two groups (4.23+/-5.49% vs 4.80+/-4.84%, p=0.481). The total lymphocyte count, the level of total cholesterol, total protein, and albumin were significantly higher in the study group after discharge. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event, and the incidence of adverse events with a severity score of >=3 did not differ between groups (2.3% vs 1.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: The utility of routine oral nutritional support after major gastrointestinal surgery was not proven in terms of weight loss at 8 weeks after discharge. However, it can be beneficial for early recovery of biochemical parameters.

AB  - Nutritional recovery was studied during continuous enteral nutrition in 29 patients who had developed malnutrition after gastric surgery. Patients were divided into three groups according to the type of surgery involved: total gastrectomy (n = 10), partial gastrectomy (n = 12), or cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 7). The evolution of anthropometric and biological nutritional parameters in each group was compared with that observed in a control group of 10 nonoperated anorectic patients. Significant gains in body weight, arm muscle circumference, triceps skinfold, serum transferrin and global nutritional status were observed after 3 to 4 weeks of enteral nutrition in each group, while serum albumin, serum cholesterol, hemoglobin, and total lymphocyte count did not change significantly. No significant difference was observed between the groups. However, weight gain tended to be slower in patients with cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy. This study confirms that enteral nutrition is an effective method of nutritional repletion after gastrectomy. Enteral nutrition can be used in undernourished gastrectomized patients when dietary measures alone have proven inadequate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections(SSIs)occur at a high frequency in patients after rectal cancer surgery and are readily aggravated. Therefore, prophylactic measures for infections based on the evaluation of the patient's perioperative risk are very important. We investigated risk factors of SSI onset in patients after rectal cancer surgery., METHODS: In total, 66 patients with rectal cancer who underwent resection in our department between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively examined., RESULTS: The patients in our study included 38 men and 28 women with a median age of 66 years and a median BMI of 21.3 kg/m2. Fifteen patients underwent laparotomy and 51 underwent laparoscopy. Among 66 patients, 24 had an artificial anus. The median operative time was 367 minutes, median bleeding loss was 100 mL, and median Controlling Nutritional Status(CONUT)score was 2. Twenty patients developed SSI after rectal cancer surgery. Univariate analysis demonstrated that operative time(p=0.004, OR: 1.005, 95%CI: 1.002-1.009)and CONUT score(p=0.035, OR: 1.386, 95%CI: 1.023-1.878) were significant risk factors for SSI development. Multivariate analysis also demonstrated that operative time(p=0.003, OR: 1.006, 95%CI: 1.002-1.010)and CONUT score(p=0.025, OR: 1.508, 95%CI: 1.053-2.161)were significant risk factors for SSI development., CONCLUSIONS: The CONUT score was identified as a significant preoperative risk factor for SSI after rectal cancer surgery in both the univariate and multivariate analyses. Therefore, the preoperative evaluation using the CONUT score may be useful for predicting the risk of SSI in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin (Alb) ratio has been reported as a novel prognostic marker in several cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio in patients who underwent surgery for adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) and upper gastric cancer (UGC)., METHODS: Data for 144 patients who underwent surgery for AEG and UGC were reviewed. The CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow Prognostic Score, and controlling nutritional status score were calculated, and the relationship between these biomarkers and postoperative prognosis was analyzed., RESULTS: The optimal cutoff value of the CRP/Alb ratio was determined to be 0.1. According to the cutoff value of CRP/Alb ratio, patients were divided into two groups (CRP/Alb < 0.1, n = 124; CRP/Alb >= 0.1, n = 20). The 5-year recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower in the patients with the CRP/Alb ratio >= 0.1 than in those with the CRP/Alb ratio < 0.1 (recurrence-free survival: 44.9% vs 77.9%, P = 0.0011; OS: 43.4% vs 82.0%, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analyses, the N-stage, and CRP/Alb ratio >= 0.1 were identified as independent predictive factors for OS in patients with AEG and UGC (P = 0.0061 and P = 0.0439, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The CRP/Alb ratio was strongly associated with poor prognosis in patients who underwent surgery for AEG and UGC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), as calculated from serum albumin, total cholesterol concentration, and total lymphocyte count, was previously shown to be useful for nutritional assessment. The current study investigated the potential use of CONUT as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer patients after curative resection., METHODS: Preoperative CONUT was retrospectively calculated in 416 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative resection at Kumamoto University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. The patients were divided into two groups: CONUT-high (>=4) and CONUT-low (<=3), according to time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The associations of CONUT with clinicopathological factors and survival were evaluated., RESULTS: CONUT-high patients were significantly older (p < 0.001) and had a lower body mass index (p = 0.019), deeper invasion (p < 0.001), higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen (p = 0.037), and higher serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (p = 0.007) compared with CONUT-low patients. CONUT-high patients had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) compared with CONUT-low patients according to univariate and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio: 5.09, 95% confidence interval 3.12-8.30, p < 0.001). In time-dependent ROC analysis, CONUT had a higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the prediction of 5-year OS than the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, the Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, or pStage. When the time-dependent AUC curve was used to predict OS, CONUT tended to maintain its predictive accuracy for long-term survival at a significantly higher level for an extended period after surgery when compared with the other markers tested., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT is useful for not only estimating nutritional status but also for predicting long-term OS in gastric cancer patients after curative resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that preoperative anemia negatively influences survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC). We sought to investigate which anemic markers can better predict the prognosis of patients with resectable GC., METHODS: The study involved 2277 GC patients who underwent curative resection between December 2008 and December 2014. Cox regression models were used to identify the best anemic markers associated with prognosis. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis (t-ROC) and the estimated area under the curve (AUC) were used to compare the prognostic values., RESULTS: Of all patients, 1709 (75.1%) were male, and the median age was 61 years. Univariate analyses showed that preoperative hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume were associated with OS (all P < 0.05). However, in a separate analysis of individual stages, only HCT was shown to be significantly prognostic across all tumor stages (all P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, preoperative HCT remained an independent prognostic factor for GC. Low HCT was significantly associated with older age, female sex, lower body mass index, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score, higher preoperative transfusion rate, 90-day mortality, adjuvant chemotherapy, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, later stage, and vascular involvement. The t-ROC curve and AUC for HCT were similar to those for the controlling nutritional status and prognostic nutritional index throughout the observation period., CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative HCT is a novel, simple, and powerful prognostic indicator of poor outcome in patients with GC and can be used as a part of the preoperative risk stratification process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of three nutritional scoring systems: Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), and Naples Prognostic Score (NPS) on the short- or long-term prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients who underwent radical gastrectomy., METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 2182 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (FMUUH) from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The effects of the PNI, CONUT, and NPS on the short- or long-term prognosis of GC patients were analyzed., RESULTS: Overall, 359 (16.5%) patients had postoperative complications. There was no significant association between the PNI, CONUT, and NPS and postoperative complications (P > 0.05); however, high CONUT and NPS were significantly associated with severe postoperative complications (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that PNI, CONUT, and NPS were all associated with overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001). However, multivariate analysis showed that only PNI was an independent risk factor for OS (P = 0.004), and the 5-year OS rate in the low PNI group was significantly lower than that in the normal PNI group (55.5% vs 75.4%, P < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) and the c-index of PNI were significantly higher than those of CONUT and NPS. The prognostic efficiency of combining PNI and TNM stage was also significantly better than that of TNM staging alone (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that CONUT and NPS are important for assessing the risk of severe postoperative complications. However, PNI is an independent risk factor for the long-term prognosis of GC patients who underwent radical gastrectomy and can improve the prognostic efficiency of TNM staging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) has been reported in many malignancies. In present study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of CONUT in gastric cancer (GC) receiving curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 697 consecutive patients undergoing curative surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage II-III GC between November 2000 and September 2012. Patients were classified into high (>=3) and low (<=2) CONUT groups according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis., RESULTS: Of the included patients, 217 (31.1%) belonged to the high CONUT group. The high CONUT group had a significantly lower 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate than the low CONUT group (39.3 vs. 55.5%, P < 0.001). High CONUT score was significantly associated with larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, and poorer nutritional status, including lower body mass index (BMI), higher prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the presence of preoperative anemia (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that CONUT score was an independent prognostic factor (HR: 1.553; 95% CI: 1.080-2.232; P = 0.017). Of note, in the low PNI group, CONUT score still effectively stratified CSS (P = 0.016). Furthermore, the prognostic significance of CONUT score was also maintained when stratified by TNM stage (all P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT score is considered a useful nutritional marker for predicting prognosis in stage II-III GC patients undergoing curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, and may help to facilitate the planning of preoperative nutritional interventions.

AB  - Preoperative nutritional status plays an important role in predicting postoperative outcomes. Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) are good tools to assess patients' nutritional status. They have been used in predicting outcomes in various malignancies, but few studies have focused on pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Totally, 306 PDAC patients were enrolled. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was introduced to eliminate the baseline inequivalence. Patients with different PNI (or CONUT) scores showed inequivalence baseline characteristics, and patients with compromised nutritional status were related with a more advanced tumour stage. After PSM, the baseline characteristics were well balanced. Both low PNI (<=45) and high CONUT (>=3) were independent risk factors for poor overall survival (P < 0.05), and the result remained the same after PSM. Survival analysis demonstrated both patients with low PNI and high CONUT score were associated with poorer survival, and the result remained the same after PSM. The results of AUC indicated that CONUT might have a higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting complications and survival. Preoperative low PNI (<=45) and high CONUT (>=3) scores might be reliable predictors of prognosis and surgical complications in PDAC patients. Compared with PNI, CONUT might be more effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The present study aimed to compare the utility of various inflammatory marker- and nutritional status-based prognostic factors, including many previous established prognostic factors, for predicting the prognosis of stage IV gastric cancer patients undergoing non-curative surgery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients with stage IV gastric cancer who had undergone palliative gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between the mGPS, PNI, NLR, PLR, the CONUT, various clinicopathological factors and cancer-specific survival (CS)., RESULTS: Among patients who received non-curative surgery, univariate analysis of CS identified the following significant risk factors: chemotherapy, mGPS and NLR, and multivariate analysis revealed that the mGPS was independently associated with CS., CONCLUSION: The mGPS was a more useful prognostic factor than the PNI, NLR, PLR and CONUT in patients undergoing non-curative surgery for stage IV gastric cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have examined controlling nutritional status (CONUT), which is one of the useful biomarkers for predicting patients' prognosis following cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of CONUT as a postoperative prognostic marker in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) following curative hepatectomy., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 71 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for ICC between May 2002 and November 2016. Patients were divided into two groups according to their preoperative CONUT score (i.e., CONUT 2 or CONUT < 2)., RESULTS: The number of patients assigned to the normal, mild, moderate, or severe malnutrition groups was 40, 28, two, and one, respectively. The high CONUT group (CONUT 2) consisted of 31 patients (43.7%) and had a poor prognosis with regard to overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0149). A high CONUT score is also identified as one of the independent predictors of poor prognosis in OS (hazard ratio 3.02; 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.8; p = 0.007). However, in the current study, a high CONUT score was not associated with postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification III or more)., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT may be useful for the preoperative assessment of prognosis in patients with ICC who have undergone curative hepatectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional and immunological statuses are attracting increasing attention for their ability to predict surgical outcomes in various cancers. The Naples prognostic score (NPS) consists of the serum albumin level, total cholesterol level, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio and could be useful for predicting survival., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 196 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative R0/R1 resection with a surgery-first strategy between June 2003 and August 2016. The NPS of the patients was calculated from preoperative data, and the patients were then divided into three groups based on their NPS. Clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival were compared, and multivariate analysis of overall survival was conducted., RESULTS: Of a total of 196 patients, 22 were classified into group 0 (NPS 0), 113 into group 1 (NPS 1 or 2), and 61 into group 2 (NPS 3 or 4). Median survival time was 103.4 months in group 0, 33.3 months in group 1, and 21.3 months in group 2. Significant survival differences were observed among the 3 groups (group 1 vs. 2, group 0 vs. 2, P = 0.0380, P = 0.0022, respectively). On multivariate analysis, NPS was identified as an independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78; P = 0.0131]; however, there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative morbidity among the NPS groups., CONCLUSIONS: The NPS could be an easy scoring system and an independent preoperative predictor of survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The safety of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for esophageal cancer has not been adequately confirmed., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twelve patients who underwent MIE for esophageal cancer at the Kumamoto University Hospital between May 2011 and June 2018 were enrolled. A total of 46 patients received NAC and underwent subsequent MIE. The control group comprised 166 patients who underwent MIE without any preoperative treatments. We retrospectively investigated the patient-related, tumor-related, and surgery-related factors, as well as the short-term outcomes, between the two groups., RESULTS: Preoperative lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin and albumin levels were significantly lower in the NAC plus MIE group than in the MIE alone group. Preoperative nutritional status, as measured by the prognostic nutrition index and controlling nutritional status, was also poorer in the NAC plus MIE group (p<0.001). However, short-term outcomes such as operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and incidence of postoperative complications were statistically equivalent between the groups., CONCLUSION: Although administration of NAC was associated with a poorer preoperative condition, it did not worsen the short-term outcomes after MIE.

AB  - The efficacy of early enteral nutrition after esophageal cancer surgery has been reported. However, the choice of formula and management of diarrhea are important to achieve the goal of enhanced recovery after surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of diarrhea/completion rate of enteral nutrition regimen as primary endpoints and the postoperative nutritional status/body composition analysis/operative morbidity as secondary endpoints was compared between the two nutrition groups. Among the 122 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between December 2015 and September 2017, 67 patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive enteral nutrition with either HINE E-GEL R (HINE group; n = 33) or MEIN R (MEIN group; n = 34). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower in the HINE group (18.2 % vs. 64.7 %, P < 0.001). The score of Bristol scale of POD 6/7 was significantly lower in the HINE group (P = 0.019/P = 0.006, respectively). The completion rate of enteral nutrition regimen was significantly higher in the HINE group (97.4 % vs. 86.6 %, P = 0.002). The Controlling Nutritional Status scores and total protein levels at 6 months after surgery were significantly better in the HINE group (P = 0.030 and P = 0.023, respectively), indicating improved tendency in nutritional status in the HINE group. However, there were no significant differences in Prognostic Nutritional Index values, blood test results, rapid turnover proteins, body mass index, or body composition between the two groups. HINE E-GEL compared with MEIN may reduce the frequency of diarrhea, enabling patients to adhere to the scheduled enteral nutrition plan. Also, maintenance of nutritional status with HINE E-GEL was comparable or potentially better in some nutrition components to that with MEIN, indicating that HINE E-GEL can be an option for enteral nutrition following esophageal surgery to achieve the goal of successful completion of scheduled enteral nutrition and smooth transition to the normal diet.

AB  - Twenty patients undergoing uneventful gastrectomy were randomly assigned to receive TPN containing either 10% Intralipid or 10% Lipofundin (MCT/LCT) beginning postoperative day (POD) 1 through POD 6. Patients were given non-protein energy 27 kcal/kg/d and nitrogen 0.14 g/kg/d through peripheral vein along with fat emulsion. Body weight, hemoglobin, blood lymphocyte count, SGPT, serum bilirubin, AKP, BUN, Cr, serum albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, fibronectin, creatine phosphokinase, serum and plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, blood sugar, serum insulin, urinary creatinine and nitrogen balance were monitored. It was found that MCT-based fat emulsion was tolerated without any side effects. Kinetics study showed that levels of medium chain free fatty acids increased during MCT-based fat emulsion infusion, but returned to normal within 2 hours on cessation of infusion, indicating good clearance of MCT. Plasma concentration of triglycerides in the LCT group was higher than that in the MCT group at 2 hours after infusion. On POD 6, better nitrogen balance was observed in the MCT group, 0.44 +/- 0.21 g/d (-1.4 +/- 0.51 g/d in the LCT group). Urinary excretion of creatinine in the MCT group was also less than in the LCT group (0.76 +/- 0.03 g/d vs. 1.034 +/- 0.11 g/d). LCT was also observed to induce an elevation of serum bilirubin (1.12 +/- 0.11 mg/dl). These results indicate that MCT-based fat emulsion appears to be a safe energy source.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is a newly developed laboratory-derived immunonutritional score which has been validated as prognostic marker for survival and tumor recurrence in surgically treated patients with various tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to test the CONUT score performance in HCC patients treated with liver transplantation (LT)., METHODS: A retrospective study on a bi-centers cohort of 280 HCC patients submitted to LT between 2006 and 2017 was performed. Indication to LT was limited to Milan criteria or UCSF criteria, defined by preoperative imaging., RESULTS: Median pre-LT CONUT score was 5 (interquartile range 3-7). Overall patients' survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 84%, 76.6%, and 68.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HCC recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.987, P = .012] and pre-LT neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 1.064, P = .003) were independent risk factors for reduced survival. Cumulative incidence of HCC recurrence at 1, 3, and 5 years was 5.1%, 11.5%, and 15.5%, respectively. Pre-LT platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] = 1.086, P = .044], tumor max diameter (SHR = 1.695, P < .001), and bilobar tumor distribution (SHR = 6.892, P = .006) were independent risk factors for tumor recurrence. The CONUT score did not show any prognostic value., CONCLUSIONS: The CONUT score did not predict poor survival or tumor recurrence in LT recipients. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, which comprehensively reflects protein and lipid metabolism as well as the immunocompetence among patients with stage 2 or 3 gastric cancer., METHODS: From a retrospective database of 3484 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer at nine Japanese institutions between 2010 and 2014, data for 626 patients with stage 2 or 3 cancer were retrieved. The study evaluated the significance of the associations between the optimal CONUT score cutoff values with the prognosis and the incidence of postoperative complications., RESULTS: The study determined that 2 was the optimal CONUT score cutoff value for predicting mortality 2 years after surgery. The patients with a CONUT score of 2 or higher (CONUT-high group) were significantly older and had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, lower body mass index, and more advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage than the patients with a CONUT score lower than 2 (CONUT-low group). Overall, the survival time was significantly shorter in the CONUT-high group than in the CONUT-low group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.97; P < 0.0001]. A multivariable analysis showed that the CONUT score was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival. The CONUT score more significantly reflected the overall survival for patients who underwent postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy than for those who underwent surgery alone. Additionally, a high preoperative CONUT score was significantly associated with an increased incidence of postoperative pneumonia and prolonged hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that the preoperative CONUT score may be a useful predictor of postoperative short- and long-term outcomes for patients with stage 2 or 3 gastric cancer.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative malnutrition and the relationships between objective and subjective nutritional assessment of gastric cancer patients., METHODS: From October 2005 to July 2006, we studied 80 patients with no evidence of recurrent disease and no loss to follow-up after curative surgery for gastric cancer. In this group, 9 patients underwent total gastrectomy and 71 patients subtotal gastrectomy. At admission, 6 and 12 mo after surgery, the patients were assessed on the subjective global assessment (SGA), nutritional risk screening (NRS-2002), nutritional risk index (NRI) and by anthropometric measurements and laboratory data. Differences between the independent groups were assessed with the Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the association between the scores and variables., RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition at admission was 31% by SGA and 43% by NRS-2002. At admission, the anthropometric data were lower in the malnourished groups defined by the SGA and NRS-2002 assessments, but did not differ between the groups using the NRI assessment. Body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold and midarm circumference were significantly reduced, but the total lymphocyte count, albumin, protein, cholesterol and serum iron levels did not decrease during the postoperative period. Six months after surgery, there was a good correlation between the nutritional assessment tools (SGA and NRS-2002) and the other nutritional measurement tools (BW, BMI, and anthropometric measurements). However, 12 mo after surgery, most patients who were assessed as malnourished by SGA and NRS-2002 had returned to their preoperative status, although their BW, BMI, and anthropometric measurements still indicated a malnourished status., CONCLUSION: A combination of objective and subjective assessments is needed for the early detection of the nutritional status in case of gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.

AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and nineteen patients with colorectal cancer who underwent laparotomy were included in this study. Indicators that reflected immunity, nutrition, and physical function were selected, and risks associated with the presence of postoperative pneumonia were investigated. Cut-off values of factors affecting the occurrence of pneumonia were determined using the receiver-operating characteristic curve approach., RESULTS: Pneumonia was observed in 2.9%of the patients, and PNI(C40.0), CONUT(B2), BMI(<18.5 kg/m2), PS(B1), %VC(<80.0%), and FEV1.0%(<70.0%)were identified as risk factors in multivariate analysis(p<0.05). %VC(<80.0%)was extracted as an independent factor. The cutoff value of %VC was determined to be 80.0%based on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia., CONCLUSION: Low volume in %VC(<80.0%)may be a risk factor for pneumonia after resection of colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association of the physical, nutritional, and immune status with adverse events in patients treated with mFOLFOX6 adjuvant chemotherapy after colorectal cancer surgery., METHOD: This study included 17 patients, 7 male and 10 female. The median age was 62( range, 32-75) years. The median number of treatment cycles was 12 (range, 4-12). Age, performance status( PS), body mass index( BMI),serum albumin level( Alb),Onodera's prognostic nutritional index( PNI), controlling nutritional status( CONUT),Glasgow prognostic score( GPS),the granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio( G/L),neutrophil count, and the total lymphocyte count( TLC) were evaluated with regard to the nutrition and immunity status of the host before chemotherapy. The incidents of toxicity of greater than Grade 2 severity, excluding gastrointestinal events or gastrointestinal toxicities, were analyzed to determine the correlation with host status., RESULT: Any toxicities and toxicities without digestive symptoms were observed in 11 patients( 64.7%),and the number of incidents was significantly increased in patients with a PNI of <45. Gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in 4 patients (23.5%), but there were no significant correlations with any of the factors investigated., CONCLUSION: Toxicities are observed to a greater extent in patients with a PNI of <45 during adjuvant chemotherapy. These findings suggest that nutritional support may be required to safely administer mFOLFOX6 adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) is an inflammation-based measure of malnutrition that reflects a state of cachexia in cancer patients. We evaluated mGPS as an index to predict surgical site infection (SSI) incidence in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 351 patients who underwent colon cancer resection. Factors correlated with the incidence of SSIs were identified by logistic analysis and stepwise selection., RESULTS: SSIs were observed in 32 patients, with an incidence of 9.1%. Univariate logistic analysis revealed mGPS (Score 2), laparotomy, resection of other organs, colostomy, excessive blood loss (>423 mL), long duration of surgery (>279 minutes), pulmonary dysfunction, prognostic nutritional index (PNI) <=40, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR)(>4), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) >=2 to be associated with an increased incidence of SSIs. Multivariate analysis with variables selected by the stepwise procedure also revealed mGPS (Score 2) (Odds ratio (OR) =3.55, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.30-9.56; p=0.01), colostomy (OR=6.56, 95%CI 1.60-31.38; p=0.01), excessive blood loss (OR=3.20, 95%CI 1.23-8.42; p=0.02), and NLR (>4)(OR=3.24, 95%CI 1.31-8.17; p=0.01) to be independent risk factors., CONCLUSION: mGPS is an independent risk factor for SSIs. Our results suggest that cachexia before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer might predict the incidence of SSIs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the preoperative patient status including nutrition, immunity, and inflammation as a predictive factor of remote infection (RI) in colorectal cancer surgery., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 351 patients who underwent colorectal cancer resection were retrospectively analyzed. Factors correlated with RI incidence were identified by logistic analysis and stepwise selection., RESULTS: RI occurred in 27 patients, with an incidence of 7.7%. In univariate logistic analysis, a significantly high incidence of RI was associated with excessive blood loss (>423 mL), long duration of surgery (>279 minutes), ileus, pulmonary dysfunction, performance status (PS) >=1, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification>2, prognostic nutritional index (PNI) <=40, and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) >=2, modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) (Score 2). In multivariate analysis, pulmonary dysfunction (odds ratio=2.83; 95% CI: 1.14-6.97; p=0.02) and PNI<=40 (odds ratio=3.87; 95% CI: 1.45-10.31; p=0.006) were independent risk factors of RI incidence., CONCLUSION: RI is caused by poor nutrition, immune system dysfunction and pulmonary dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Several immunoinflammatory and nutritional measures have been reported to be good prognostic indicators for esophageal cancer (EC). However, the association between those markers and the postoperative survival of EC patients remains unclear due to varying study designs and treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to compare the significance of preoperative immunoinflammatory and nutritional measures in patients with EC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and five patients with EC who underwent McKeown esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction without neoadjuvant therapy between 2006 and 2014 were included in this study. The prognostic values of preoperative modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were investigated using univariate and multivariate survival analyses., RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that CAR and pathological stage are independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). CAR was significantly associated with more advanced pathological stage as both a subject and a continuous variable., CONCLUSION: Preoperative CAR was an independent prognostic factor for the OS of EC patients who underwent McKeown esophagectomy. The tumor-stage related increase in CAR demonstrated that a high CAR is associated with tumor progression in EC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We worked to identify predictors of survival in patients with carcinomatosis on home parenteral nutrition (HPN)., METHODS: Survival rate was evaluated in 152 terminal patients (45 men and 107 women) with peritoneal carcinosis on HPN. Selected anthropometric measurements (weight and body mass index), laboratory tests (serum albumin, cholesterol, cholinesterase [CHE], hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count) and clinical variables (ascites, pain, and vomiting) were recorded at baseline. A Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was also determined., RESULTS: Sites of primary cancer were the stomach in 31.6%, ovaries in 27.6%, colorectum in 19.7%, and other in 21.1%. At baseline patients had abnormally low values: 55.3% had a body mass index no greater than 20.0 kg/m2, 40.4% had a serum albumin level lower than 3.0 g/dL, 55.7% had a lymphocyte count no higher than 1200/mm3, 54.6% had a cholesterol level lower than 160 mg/dL, and 63.1% had a CHE level lower than 5400 U/L. Pain, ascites, vomiting, and a KPS score no higher than 40 were observed in 44.1%, 55.3%, 76.3%, and 51.3% of patients, respectively. Survival ranged from 6 to 1269 d (median 45 d). Patients with a KPS score no higher than 40 had shorter survival than did patients with a KPS score of at least 50 (median 28.5 versus 81, P = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis (R2 = 0.152 for the entire model) indicated that KPS (P = 0.01) and CHE (P = 0.034) were significant predictors of survival. Moreover, three different combinations of selected clinical and laboratory variables identified patients who survived fewer than 60 d (high specificity)., CONCLUSIONS: Time of survival widely varied among terminal cancer patients; identification of predictive factors could help to draw up guidelines to improve indications for HPN. In this study, traditional predictors (KPS, albumin, pain, and vomiting) and CHE level appeared to be a useful survival predictor index in incurable patients with peritoneal carcinosis on HPN.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of surgical intervention for chronic pancreatitis (CP) is to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. However, the precise effect of surgery on the nutritional status of CP patients, which is often impaired by exocrine and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, has not been elucidated. We conducted this study to evaluate whether Frey's procedure improves the nutritional status of CP patients., METHODS: The nutritional status of 35 patients who underwent Frey's procedure for CP at our institute between April 2005 and December 2014, was assessed by the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) scoring before and 1 year after the surgery, and compared with that of seven CP patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. The occurrence of postoperative hepatic steatosis was also monitored., RESULTS: The nutritional status improved after Frey's procedure, but not after pancreatoduodenectomy. The median postoperative CONUT score after Frey's procedure was significantly lower than the preoperative score (1.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.0 +/- 2.5; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Frey's procedure is superior to pancreatoduodenectomy for improving the nutritional status of CP patients.

AB  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is performed for gallbladder stones and cholecystitis in a large number of elderly patients. However, the safety of LC in the elderly is questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate predictive factors for the incidence of postoperative complications and deaths after LC in patients aged 80 years and older. Data from 85 elderly patients who underwent LC between January 2005 and December 2015 were prospectively collected in a database at our hospital. The following factors were compared for the occurrence of postoperative complications and deaths:age, gender, Body Mass Index, laboratory date, severity grade of cholecystitis, comorbidity of choledocholithiasis, conversion to open cholecystectomy, early or delayed LC, amount of time from onset to LC, operative duration, blood loss, and the following scoring systems for predicting risk of surgery:ECOG-PS, ASA, SIRS, CONUT, POSSUM, SAS, E-PASS. The complication rate of LC was 14.1% in this cohort. WBC, CRP, BUN, Cre, Na, PT-INR, severity of cholecystitis, conversion to open cholecystectomy, operative duration, early LC, ASA, SIRS, CONUT, POSSUM (PS, OS, complication rate), SAS, E-PASS (PRS, SSS, CRS) showed significant variability in univariate analysis. A high POSSUM score of complication and moderate or severe cholecystitis were independent risk factors for postoperative complication. Analysis of the ROC showed that the best cut-off point for the POSSUM score of complication was 51.5. LC for gallbladder stones and cholecystitis in elderly is a reliable operation, but the procedure for cases with a high score of the POSSUM for complications, or moderate or severe cholecystitis, may have the risk of postoperative complications in elderly patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score, originally developed as a nutritional screening tool, is a cumulative score calculated from the serum albumin level, total cholesterol level, and total lymphocyte count. Previous studies have demonstrated that the score has significant prognostic value in various malignancies. We investigated the relationship between the CONUT score and long-term survival in obstructive colorectal cancer (OCRC) patients who underwent self-expandable metallic colonic stent placement and subsequently received curative surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 57 pathological stage II and III OCRC patients between 2013 and 2019. The associations between the preoperative CONUT score and clinicopathological factors and patient survival were evaluated., RESULTS: A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for the CONUT score was 7. A CONUT score of >= 7 was significantly associated with elevated CA19-9 level (p = 0.03). Multivariate analyses revealed that a CONUT score of >= 7 was independently associated with cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 10.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-85.9, p = 0.03) and disease-free survival (HR = 7.1, 95% CI 2.3-21.7, p = 0.0006)., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the CONUT score was a potent prognostic indicator. Evaluating the CONUT score might result in more precise patient assessment and tailored treatment.

AB  - Weight loss and malnutrition are common in cancer patients. Although weight loss is predominantly due to loss of fat mass, the morbidity risk is given by the decrease in muscle mass. The assessment of nutritional status is essential for a diagnosis of nutritional compromise and required for the multidisciplinary approach. Subjective global assessment (SGA) is made by the patients nutritional symptoms and weight loss. The objective assessment, a significant weight loss (>10%) for 6 months is considered an indicator of nutritional deficiency. The mean body index, body fat mass and body protein mass are decreased as cancer stage increases. The biochemical data of albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, Zn, transferrin, total lymphocyte count are decreased in advanced cancer stage. Daily energy intake, cabohyderate and Vit B1 intake is decreased according to cancer stage. The patients are divided into three groups according to SGA. The three groups showed a significant difference in body weight, 1 month weight loss%, 6 month weight loss%, body mass index, mid arm circumference, albumin, energy intake, as well as carbohyderate intake protein and energy malnutrition. Nutritional assessment is of great importance because undernutrition has been shown to be associated with increase in stomach cancer associated morbidity and mortality. The authors concluded that nutritional assessment should be done in cancer patients preoperatively, and with adequate nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality would be decreased.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the impact of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, an immuno-nutritional biomarker, on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with lenvatinib (LEN). This retrospective study enrolled 164 patients with HCC and treated with LEN (median age 73 years, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C 93/71). Factors associated with overall survival (OS) were evaluated using multivariate and decision tree analyses. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Independent factors for OS were albumin-bilirubin grade 1, BCLC stage B, and CONUT score <5 (hazard ratio (HR) 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58-5.31, p < 0.001). The CONUT score was the most important variable for OS, with OS rates of 70.0% and 29.0% in the low and high CONUT groups, respectively. Additionally, the median survival time was longer in the low CONUT group than in the high CONUT group (median survival time not reached vs. 11.3 months, p < 0.001). The CONUT score was the most important prognostic variable, rather than albumin-bilirubin grade and BCLC stage, in patients with HCC treated with LEN. Accordingly, immuno-nutritional status may be an important factor in the management of patients with HCC treated with LEN.

AB  - Esophagectomy is a most invasive operation, as compared with other operations of the gastrointestinal tract. Obstructions of the food passageway and the overgrowth of tissue postoperatively may lead to malnutrition. Therefore, significant assessment and management of nutrients is very important for esophageal cancer patients. The body mass index, albumin, the prognostic nutritional index, controlling nutritional status, and the Glasgow Prognostic Score are reported as useful assessment tools for esophageal cancer. The patient's general condition, including his or her nutritional status, influences the performance of esophagectomy. Therefore, improving the nutritional status enables an adaptation of therapy and leads to preventive benefits for decreasing postoperative complications. The previously cited nutritional tools are very useful indices because the measurement of each factor is convenient and fast. Also, early recovery from operative stress is the most important target of postoperative management after esophagectomy. Accurate and adequate perioperative management allows early recovery from operative stress in esophageal cancer patients. Preoperative steroid injection, oral care, respiratory training and rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and so on are very important for esophageal cancer patients. The efforts of a team that includes doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers are necessary for sufficient postoperative management after esophagectomy.

AB  - The nutritional status of the donor has been shown to affect the outcome of liver transplantation in the rat. It has been proposed that this may be due to inhibition of Kupffer cell induced injury to the reperfused organ, which leads to an inflammatory type response. In this study we investigated how altering the nutritional status of the recipient affects the outcome of liver transplantation after preservation of the liver for 44 or 48 h in the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. The nutritional status of the rats was altered by either fasting or by feeding an essential fatty acid free diet (EFAD) for 2 months. This type of diet has been shown to reduce significantly the inflammatory response in rats. Survival after 44-h preservation of livers from fed donors (fed a standard laboratory diet) transplanted to fed recipients was 29% (2/7) but increased to 80% (4/5) when the recipient was fed the EFAD diet. After 48-h preservation, there were no survivors under either of these two dietary combinations. However, survival was 100% after 48-h preservation if the donor had been fasted for 4 days and the recipient was fed the EFAD. These results showed that the nutritional status of the donor and recipient are important factors in the outcome of liver transplantation. How nutritional factors affect liver preservation and transplantation are not clear but may be related to the inflammatory response regulated by Kupffer cells and circulating neutrophils in the liver, both of which are influenced by the diet of the animal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative nutritional status is considered to affect the short-term and long-term outcomes of cancer patients. The clinical value of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in elderly patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer remains unknown., METHODS: This study reviewed 211 elderly patients aged 75 years or over who underwent curative resection for gastric cancer from 2000 to 2015. Patients were grouped according to the preoperative CONUT score into those with normal nutrition (75 patients), light malnutrition (100 patients) and moderate or severe malnutrition (36 patients). The predictive value of the CONUT score for postoperative morbidity and survival was assessed., RESULTS: Impaired nutrition was associated with cardiovascular disease (P = 0.012) and chronic kidney disease (P = 0.014), and worsened malnutrition was linked to advanced age (P = 0.004), decreased body mass index (P = 0.008) and advanced disease stage (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed the CONUT score as an independent predictor of procedure-unrelated infectious morbidity (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-5.40; P = 0.046). Patients with a higher CONUT score had significantly shorter overall survival in both stage I and stage II/III gastric cancer (P = 0.044 and P = 0.007, respectively) and reduced cancer-specific survival in stage II/III (P = 0.003) The CONUT score was a strong predictors of overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.18-3.69; P = 0.012) and cancer-specific survival (HR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.30-10.43; P = 0.015) independent of disease stage., CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative CONUT score is a simple and promising predictor of postoperative procedure-unrelated infectious morbidity and prognosis in elderly gastric cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical evidence of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score for outcomes has increased in gastroenterological surgical oncology. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the CONUT score on outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)., METHODS: A literature review was systematically conducted to evaluate the significance of the CONUT score in CRC patients. Meta-analyses of survival were performed to investigate the effects of the CONUT score in CRC patients., RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and six studies with 2601 patients were included in the present meta-analyses. High CONUT score was associated with poor overall survival (HR 1.97, 95%CI = 1.40-2.77, P < 0.001), cancer-specific survival (HR 3.64, 95%CI = 1.96-6.75, P < 0.001), and recurrence/relapse-free survival (HR 1.68, 95%CI = 1.23-2.29, P = 0.001) after CRC surgery., CONCLUSIONS: The CONUT score is a practical prognostic factor associated with prognosis of CRC. Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of the CONUT score in CRC patients. Copyright © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is associated with prognosis in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients, but the clinical significance of the CONUT score for postoperative short-term outcome remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the CONUT score on postoperative outcomes in patients with GI and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers. We conducted a systematic literature search of Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) for postoperative complications in patients with lower -CONUT score versus higher CONUT score. Furthermore, we explored the most appropriate cutoff value of the CONUT score to predict postoperative complications. Ten retrospective studies (5,138 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Patients with higher CONUT score had an increased risk of mortality (RR 5.38, 95% CI 2.19-13.2, p < 0.001, I2 = 0%), postoperative major complications (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.33, p= 0.03, I2 = 79%), and overall complications (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16-1.63, p < 0.001, I2 = 6%). We found that the cutoff of CONUT <=4 vs. CONUT >=5 had the highest pooled RR compared with other cutoff values (RR 4.79, 95% CI 0.97-23.5, p= 0.05, I2 = 91%). In conclusion, the present study suggests that the preoperative CONUT score was associated with an increased risk of mortality and complications in GI and HPB surgical oncology. Patients with higher CONUT score as compared with those having a lower score had approximately a fivefold mortality risk and an increased risk up to 55% on major and overall complications after GI and HPB surgery. Our analysis indicates that the appropriate cutoff value of the CONUT score to predict postoperative major complications would be between 4 and 5. The preoperative evaluation of the CONUT score would be helpful for predicting the risk of postoperative outcomes. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical value of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review the association between the CONUT score and outcomes in patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC., METHODS: Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to examine the prognostic value of the CONUT score in HCC patients., RESULTS: A total of five studies including 4679 patients were found to be eligible and analyzed in the meta-analysis. The CONUT score was significantly associated with overall survival (HR 1.78, 95%CI = 1.20-2.64, P = 0.004, I2 = 79%), recurrence-free survival (HR 1.34, 95%CI = 1.17-1.53, P < 0.001, I2 = 16%) and postoperative major complications (OR 1.85, 95%CI: 1.19-2.87, P = 0.006, I2 = 72%) in HCC patients. Moreover, the CONUT score was associated with the Child-Pugh classification, liver cirrhosis, ICGR15, and tumor differentiation. However, it was not associated with tumor size, tumor number, and microvascular invasion., CONCLUSIONS: The CONUT score is an independent prognostic indicator of the prognosis and is associated with postoperative major complications and hepatic functional reserve in HCC patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the clinical evidence of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score has increased in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the association between the preoperative CONUT score and outcomes in patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer (GC)., METHODS: A systematic literature search for studies reporting the prognostic impact of the CONUT score in patients with GC was conducted. Meta-analyses of survival, postoperative outcomes, and postoperative clinico-pathological parameters were conducted., RESULTS: Five studies with 2482 patients were found to be eligible and subsequently reviewed and analyzed. The CONUT score was significantly associated with overall survival (HR 1.85, 95%CI 1.38-2.48, P < 0.001), cancer-specific survival (HR 2.56, 95%CI 1.24-5.28, P = 0.01) and recurrence/relapse-free survival (HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.12-1.82, P = 0.004). Moreover, the CONUT score was associated with the incidence of postoperative complications (OR 1.39, P = 0.003) and mortality (OR 6.97, P = 0.04), and clinico-pathological parameters (T factor [OR 1.75, P < 0.001], N factor [OR 1.51, P < 0.001], TNM stage [OR 1.73, P < 0.001], and microvascular invasion [OR 1.50, P = 0.006]), but not with tumor differentiation (OR 0.85, P = 0.13)., CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative CONUT score is an independent prognostic indicator of survival and postoperative complications, and is associated with clinico-pathological parameters in patients with GC.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hospitalized patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can develop severe nutritional deficits. However, the nutritional screening tools with the most utility for such patients are still unknown., METHODS: Nutritional status of 40 CD patients was assessed on admission using several screening tools and laboratory tests. Their validity was evaluated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS) and intestinal resection. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict prolonged LOS (>=28 days)., RESULTS: Prolonged LOS was correlated with each of the following screening parameters: Subjective Global Assessment, Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002), Onodera's Prognostic Nutritional Index (O-PNI), Controlling Nutritional Status, serum albumin level, and weight loss. These parameters were not correlated with intestinal resection. Evaluation of prognostic yield showed cutoff values of serum albumin 3.3 g/dL (AUC 0.797, sensitivity 57.1%, specificity 89.5%) and O-PNI 36.5 (0.749, 71.4%, 73.7%). By combining the serum albumin cutoff value and NRS 2002 score, patients were divided into 4 groups, with a prolonged LOS rate of 68.2% in the group with the worst prognosis., CONCLUSIONS: A combination of serum albumin (given the simplicity of testing) and NRS 2002 as nutritional screening tools may be useful for hospitalized CD patients.

AB  - The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score was developed as a nutritional score that can be calculated from the serum albumin level, total cholesterol concentration, and total lymphocyte count. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic factors for the overall survival (OS) of pancreatic cancer patients following a curative resection and to compare the CONUT score with other prognostic factors to demonstrate its utility. Between January 2007 and December 2015, 307 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were divided into a low CONUT group (LC; CONUT score <= 3) and a high CONUT group (HC; CONUT score >= 4) according to the results of their preoperative blood examination. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients were evaluated retrospectively. The prognostic factors of PDAC were detected using multivariate analyses. The LC and HC groups included 279 and 28 patients, respectively. The overall survival of the LC group was better than that of the HC group (LC, median survival time [MST] 27.9 months, 5-year survival rate 33.4%, respectively; HC, 13.9 months, 6.7%, p < 0.001). The multivariate analyses showed that age >= 70 years, lymph node metastasis, absence of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, CA19-9 >= 200 U/ml, and a preoperative CONUT score >= 4 were independently associated with poor survival. However, the Glasgow prognostic score, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio and prognostic nutritional index were not significant factors. The CONUT score may be useful for predicting the long-term survival of patients with PDAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, calculated from serum albumin and total cholesterol concentrations and total lymphocyte count, is reportedly valuable for nutritional assessment. This study investigated whether CONUT score was predictive of outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing surgical resection., METHODS: Preoperative CONUT scores were retrospectively evaluated in 417 CRC patients who underwent potentially curative resection at Kumamoto University Hospital from March 2005 to August 2014. Patients were divided into four groups based on preoperative CONUT scores: normal, light, moderate, and severe. The associations of CONUT score with clinicopathological factors, patient survival, and postoperative complications were examined., RESULTS: CONUT score correlated significantly with age (P < 0.001), body mass index (P = 0.005), carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.002), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (P = 0.005) concentrations. Overall survival (OS) rate was significantly lower in patients with moderate/severe than light or normal CONUT scores. CONUT score was independently prognostic of OS [moderate/severe vs. normal, hazard ratio = 5.92, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.30-14.92; P < 0.001)]. Patients with moderate/severe CONUT scores were at greater risk for complications, especially for severe complications. Multivariate analysis showed that CONUT score was independently predictive of severe complications (moderate/severe vs. normal, odds ratio = 4.51, 95 % CI 1.89-10.74; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT score may predict survival and postoperative severe complications in CRC patients undergoing potentially curative resection. Management of CRC patients may need consideration of host nutritional status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score on survival compared with the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) in patients with resectable thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)., METHODS: One hundred eighty-five consecutive patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy with curative intent for resectable thoracic ESCC were retrospectively reviewed. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for 3-year overall survival (OS) as the endpoint were performed, and the maximal Youden indices were calculated to assess discrimination ability and to determine the appropriate cut-off values of CONUT, PLR, and NLR. The patients were then classified into high and low groups based on these cut-off values. Correlations between CONUT and other clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Prognostic factors predicting overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models., RESULTS: The areas under the curve predicting 3-year OS were 0.603 for CONUT, 0.561 for PLR, 0.564 for NLR, and 0.563 for GPS. The optimal cut-off values were two for the CONUT score, 193 for PLR, and 3.612 for NLR. The high-CONUT group was significantly associated with lower BMI, high-PLR, high-NLR, and GPS1/2 groups. On univariate analysis, high-CONUT, high-PLR, high-NLR, and GPS 1/2 groups were significantly associated with poorer OS and RFS. Of these factors, multivariate analysis revealed that only the CONUT score was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.303, 95 % CI 1.191-4.455; p = 0.013) and RFS (HR 2.163, 95 % CI 1.139-4.109; p = 0.018)., CONCLUSIONS: The CONUT score was an independent predictor of OS and RFS before treatment and was superior to PLR, NLR, and GPS in terms of predictive ability for prognosis in patients with resectable thoracic ESCC.

AB  - Backgound: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) scorescore for predicting postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 108 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomy cases performed at the Surgery Department of Iwakuni Clinical Center, from April 2008 to May 2018, were included. Preoperative patient data and postoperative complication data were collected., RESULTS: Of the 108 patients (male=65; female=43; mean age=70 years), 41 (37.9%) had indication for pancreaticoduodenectomy due to pancreatic carcinoma. Grade B or higher POPF was diagnosed in 32 patients (29.6%). In the multivariate analysis, body mass index >=22 kg/m2 [odds ratio (OR)=5.24; p=0.005], CONUT score >=4 (OR=3.28; p=0.042), non-pancreatic carcinoma (OR=47.17; p=0.001), and a low computed tomographic contrast attenuation value (late/early ratio) (OR=4.39; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for POPF., CONCLUSION: Patients with high CONUT score are at high risk for POPF. Preoperative nutritional intervention such as immunonutrition might help reduce the POPF risk in these patients. Copyright© 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

AB  - Purpose: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most important factor affecting morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Patients with a high controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which is used to assess nutritional status, are expected to have high morbidity rates. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of the CONUT score., Methods: Data from 97 consecutive cases of PD performed in the Department of Surgery of Iwakuni Clinical Center, from April 2008 to May 2018, were included. Preoperative patient data, including sex, age, and hypertension, and postoperative complication data were collected to analyze pancreatic fistula occurrence., Results: Of the 97 patients, 2 9 patients (29.8%) were diagnosed with POPF >= B, with 26 cases (26.8%) classified as grade B and 3 (3.1%) as grade C. The mortality rate was 2.1% (2 of 97). In the univariate analysis, a significant association was observed between POPF and the following factors: body mass index (BMI) >= 22 kg/m2, high CONUT score, nonpancreatic carcinoma, and CT attenuation values. In multivariate analysis, BMI >= 22 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR], 6.16; P < 0.001), high CONUT score (OR, 3.77; P = 0.009), nonpancreatic carcinoma (OR, 5.72; P = 0.009), and CT attenuation values (late/early ratio) in the pancreas (OR, 9.07; P = 0.006) were independent risk factors for POPF., Conclusion: Patients with a high CONUT score are at high risk of POPF. Further study correlating preoperative nutritional intervention with risk of POPF is necessary. Copyright © 2020, the Korean Surgical Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The relationship between smoking cessation and weight gain is well recognized. However, there is no data currently available on the effect of smoking cessation on weight gain in patients with malignancy. The aim of this study was to clarify the body weight (BW) change after smoking cessation in patients with malignancy., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 159 subjects who underwent hepatobiliopancreatic surgery. The smoking status was determined using questionnaires administered at the initial presentation, and the candidates were divided into two groups: recent quitters and nonsmokers. The change in the BW was compared between these two groups., RESULTS: There were 134 subjects with malignant disease (84.3%), with a median age of 68 (range: 26-84) years. In the nonsmoker group, 28 of 116 subjects (24.1%) gained weight between the initial presentation and admission. In the recent quitter group, 12 of 18 subjects (66.7%) gained weight in the same period (P < 0.01). Regarding the change in the BW from the initial presentation, recent quitters gained more weight than nonsmokers (+1.7 kg [+2.7%] vs. -1.0 kg [-2.0%], P < 0.01). Furthermore, the improvement from the initial presentation was seen in a higher percentage of recent quitters than nonsmokers with respect to Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (61.1% vs. 36.2%, P = 0.04) and the controlling nutritional status score (38.9% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.07)., CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain due to smoking cessation was observed even in patients with hepatobiliopancreatic malignancy.

AB  - Background: The preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and serum carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) levels are individually correlated with the prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The objective of this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of CONUT score and CA199 (CONUT-CA199) combination in predicting the prognosis of PDAC patients undergoing radical surgery., Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the preoperative CONUT scores and serum CA199 levels of 294 patients with PDAC who underwent radical resection at the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University between March 2012 and July 2019. Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of their preoperative CONUT scores and serum CA199 levels: CONUTlow/CA199low (1), CONUTlow/CA199high (2), CONUThigh/CA199low (3) and CONUThigh/CA199high (4). The prognostic effects were compared among the groups., Results: CONUThigh was more frequent in patients with positive peripancreatic infiltration and Clavien-Dindo classification of >=IIIa (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed obvious difference in overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with PDAC having CONUT-CA199 scores of 1, 2, 3 and 4 (P < 0.001). Peripancreatic infiltration, lymph node metastasis, pTNM stage, CONUT score, serum CA199 levels and CONUT-CA199 classification were found to be the independent prognostic factors for OS and RFS in multivariate analyses. In time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area of the CONUT-CA199 score under the ROC curve (AUC) was higher than that of the preoperative CONUT score or serum CA199 levels for the prediction of OS and RFS., Conclusion: CONUT-CA199 classification may be more effective in predicting the postoperative prognosis of PDAC patients.

AB  - Results: There were statistically significant differences in BMI, albumin, total cholesterol, and lymphocyte count between patients from the two groups (all P < 0.05). There was no difference in the incidence rate of postoperative complications between the two groups, but there was a statistically significant difference in the total number of complications (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding abdominal drainage volume, exhaust (flatus) time, hospitalization cost, morbidity, or 60 d readmission rate (all P > 0.05). However, patients with nutritional risk had higher postoperative blood transfusion volumes, albumin infusions, weight difference before and after surgery, and postoperative hospital stays than the nonnutritional risk group (all P < 0.05). Smoking, diabetes, and preoperative nutritional risk were the risk factors by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses., Conclusions: The postoperative complication rate was increased, and the short-term efficacy was decreased in the preoperative nutritional risk group compared with those without nutritional risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients who had undergone gastric resection are considered to be high risk of developing tuberculosis. We investigated the factors leading to pulmonary tuberculosis after gastrectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 654 pulmonary tuberculosis patients discharged from Chiba-East National Hospital from January 1999 to December 2001., RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (31-84 years old, mean 63.5 +/- 12.5 years, 48 males and 7 females) had the history of gastric resection. The proportion of patients receiving gastrectomy among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was 8.4 percent. The mean age of patients received gastric resection was 50.2 +/- 16.6 years, and the mean interval from gastrectomy to the development of pulmonary tuberculosis was 13.6 +/- 11.0 years. On admission to our hospital, 34 out of 55 cases were smear positive by sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli and 39 cases had cavitary lesions on chest X-ray. Gastrectomy was done due to carcinoma of the stomach in 31 cases, peptic ulcer in 21 cases, adenomatous polyp in two cases, and accidental injury in one case. Out of total 55 cases, 52 patients improved, but three cases died of pulmonary tuberculosis. None had the recurrence of carcinoma of the stomach. Body weight, Body mass index, Prognostic nutritional index (PNI; 10 x serum albumin concentration + 0.005 x peripheral lymphocyte count) which was proposed by Onodera, serum albumin level and serum total cholesterol level were lower in the gastrectomy group than in the non-gastrectomy group. The odds ratio of developing tuberculosis among gastrectomy patients compared with the appropriate controls in 30 to 59 year-old-men was 3.8., CONCLUSION: This study confirms that gastrectomy is one of the risk factors of developing tuberculosis in 30 to 59 year-old-men. However, whether gastrectomy in itself is a risk factor or whether it is secondarily associated with another risk factor such as underweight status and/or inadequate nutrition following surgery remains unclear.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Nutritional status is strongly associated with cancer prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify the most useful combination of nutrition-related serum markers for predicting prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 523 patients who underwent proctocolectomies for CRC at our hospital were enrolled in this study. Serum concentrations of albumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol, and total peripheral lymphocyte count (TLC) were used as nutrition-related markers., RESULTS: In multivariate analysis of nutrition-related markers, serum albumin and cholinesterase levels were found to be independent prognostic indicators. Cut-off values from receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to sort patients as ChEHigh or ChELow (serum cholinesterase level >= or <221.5), and as AlbHigh or AlbLow (serum albumin level >= or <3.85). We then sorted them into three groups: ChEHigh/AlbHigh (Group A); ChEHigh/AlbLow or ChELow/AlbHigh (Group B); and ChELow/AlbLow (Group C). Their 5-year overall survival rates differed significantly (Group A: 81.6%, Group B: 62.1%, Group C: 42.7%, p<0.0001); as did their 5-year disease-specific survival rates (Group A: 90.1%, Group B: 73.8%, Group C: 62.2%, p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: The combination of serum cholinesterase and albumin levels is useful for predicting the prognosis of patients with CRC.

AB  - Background: Nutritional status is strongly associated with prognosis in cancer patients. Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is a nutritional marker based on serum albumin, cholesterol, and total lymphocyte count. We investigated the prognostic significance of a combination of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CONUT score (T-CONUT) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients., Methods: A total of 522 patients who underwent surgery for CRC at our hospital were retrospectively enrolled in this study., Results: Patients were divided into groups based on the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis as follows: CONUThigh (CONUT score >= 3) and CONUTlow (CONUT score < 3), and CEAlow (< 5 ng/mL) and CEAhigh (>= 5 ng/mL). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients in the CONUTlow and CONUThigh groups were 76.0% and 53.9%, respectively (P < 0.0001), and in the CEAlow and CEAhigh groups were 80.7% and 47.6%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Regarding T-CONUT, the 5-year OS rates of patients with CEAlow/CONUTlow, CEAlow/CONUThigh, CEAhigh/CONUTlow, and CEAhigh/CONUThigh were 84.7%, 69%, 55.3%, and 36.1%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified T-CONUT score as an independent prognostic indicator in CRC patients., Conclusion: T-CONUT may be a useful tool for predicting prognosis in CRC patients.

AB  - Background: The preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and circulating tumour cell (CTC) status are associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study is to determine whether the combination of CONUT and CTC (CONUT-CTC) could better predict the prognosis of CRC patients treated with curative resection. Methods: Preoperative CONUT score was retrospectively calculated in 160 CRC patients who underwent curative resection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 2015 to 2017. Preoperative CTC counts were enumerated from 5 ml peripheral vein blood by a CTCBIOPSY R device. According to the preoperative CONUT and CTC status, the patients were divided into three groups: CONUT-CTC (0), CONUT-CTC (1) and CONUT-CTC (2). The relationship between CONUT score and CTC, as well as the associations of CONUT-CTC status with clinicopathological factors and survival, were evaluated. Results: Preoperatively, the number and positive rate of CTC were positively correlated with the preoperative CONUT score (P<0.01). An elevated CONUT-CTC score was significantly associated with deeper tumour invasion (P=0.025), lymphatic vessel invasion (P=0.002), venous invasion (P<0.001) and higher pTNM stage (P=0.033). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests revealed significant decreases in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) among CRC patients with CONUT-CTC score of 0, 1 and 2 (P<0.001). In pTNM stage-stratified analysis, high CONUT-CTC score was significantly associated with the poor (P<0.001) and CSS (P<0.001) of patients with stage III disease, but not correlated with the prognosis of patients with stage II disease (RFS: P=0.077; CSS: P<0.090). Further univariate and multivariate analyses showed that CONUT-CTC was an independent factor affecting patients' RFS [hazard ratio (HR)=2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.79-3.96, P<0.001] and CSS (HR=3.75, 95%CI: 2.14-6.57, P<0.001). In time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, CONUT-CTC score had a higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the prediction of RFS and CSS than did preoperative CONUT score or CTC status. Conclusion: The preoperative CONUT-CTC score is associated with tumour progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC treated with curative resection, indicating that better information on CRC prognosis could be obtained from combined preoperative host immune-nutritional status and CTC detection.

AB  - Paitients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 188 patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer with laparoscopic surgery between July 2007 and March 2015. The prognostic nutrition index(PNI), modified Glas- gow prognostic score(mGPS), controlling nutritional status(CONUT), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio(N/L)were measured in these patients. We examined the association between postoperative complications and clinicopathological factors., RESULTS: The study included 110 men and 78 women. Median age was 68 years. The site of the primary lesion was colon in 118 and rectum in 70 patients. Postoperative complications higher than Grade II(Clavien-Dindo classification)were reported in 24(12.8%)patients: Surgical site infection(SSI)in 12, remote infection in 7, ileus in 5, and others in 2 patients. Clinicopathological factors related to complications were rectal surgery, large amount of intraoperative bleeding, and long operative time. The related immunologic and nutritional factors were mGPS 2, PNI below 40, and N/L above 3. CONUT was not associated with complications in ourcases., CONCLUSIONS: mGPS, PNI, and N/L are predictive factors for complications in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is an important prognostic factor for patients with liver disease and a novel nutritional assessment tool is required for these patients. The aim of this study was to validate the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) as a nutritional screening tool for patients with liver disease, by comparing MNA scores with other nutrition-related parameters., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Patients who were hospitalized at the gastroenterology division of Kyushu and Beppu Medical Center were enrolled. The study included 77 patients with liver disease (male/female, 46/31; mean+/-SD age, 68.5+/-10.7 years; liver cirrhosis, 64.9%; liver cancer, 61.0%). Correlations of MNA score at hospital admission with anthropometric parameters and blood test data were evaluated., RESULTS: In patients with liver disease, MNA scores demonstrated that 18 (23.4%) had normal nutritional status, 41 (53.2%) were at risk of malnutrition, and 18 (23.4%) were malnourished, indicating that up to 76.6% of the liver disease group were malnourished. Especially, patients with liver cirrhosis had lower scores of nutritional markers and MNA. The MNA score in liver cirrhotic patients correlated with the following parameters: % arm circumference, % triceps skinfolds, ratio of % maximum grasp strength and arm circumference, maximum grasp strength, arm muscle circumference, calf circumference, serum albumin levels, the controlling nutritional status score, and Onodera's prognostic index, while patients without liver cirrhosis did not show such correlation., CONCLUSIONS: MNA scores correlated with nutrition-related data in patients with liver cirrhosis. The MNA is an appropriate tool for nutritional screening assessment in these cirrhotic patients of any etiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A nutritional indicator suitable for predicting complications after esophagectomy has not been confirmed. The nutritional screening tool CONUT is a potential candidate., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 352 patients who underwent elective esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer between April 2005 and December 2014. Patients were divided into three groups according to the malnutrition degree in controlling nutritional status (CONUT): normal, light malnutrition, moderate or severe malnutrition., RESULTS: The numbers of patients assigned to the normal, light malnutrition, and moderate or severe malnutrition groups were 205, 126, and 21, respectively. One hundred forty-seven (41.8 %) patients were considered malnourished. Patients with moderate or severe malnutrition had a significantly high incidence of any morbidity, severe morbidities, and surgical site infection. Hospital stay in patients with moderate or severe malnutrition was significantly longer. Logistic regression analysis suggested that moderate or severe malnutrition was an independent risk factor for any morbidity [hazard ratio (HR) 2.75, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.081-7.020; p = 0.034] and severe morbidities (HR 3.07, 95 % CI 1.002-9.432; p = 0.049)., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT was a convenient and useful tool to assess nutritional status before esophagectomy. Patients with moderate or severe malnutrition according to CONUT are at high risk for postoperative complications.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to confirm the predictive value of controlling nutritional status (CONUT), as a postoperative prognostic marker for esophageal cancer patients undergoing esophagectomy., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 373 patients who underwent three-incision esophagectomy with 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer between April 2005 and March 2016. The patients were divided into three groups based on the degree of preoperative malnutrition as assessed by CONUT: normal, light malnutrition, and moderate or severe malnutrition., RESULTS: The patients with moderate or severe malnutrition experienced a significantly higher frequency of reoperation (normal or light malnutrition, 6.3%; moderate or severe malnutrition, 18.2%; P = 0.033) and a higher tendency for respiratory morbidities (normal or light malnutrition, 14.0%; moderate or severe malnutrition, 27.3%; P = 0.088). Cox regression analysis identified a significantly poor prognosis, in both overall survival (hazard ratio (HR), 3.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.714-7.390; P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.790-6.516; P = 0.046)., CONCLUSIONS: CONUT is convenient and useful for preoperatively assessing malnutrition and prognosis of esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether the prognostic nutritional index(PNI), controlling nutritional status(CONUT), modified Glasgow prognostic score(mGPS), and the neutrophil count/lymphocyte number ratio(NLR)could be prognostic factors for fStage II/III colorectal cancer., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 115 patients with fStage II/III colorectal cancer who underwent curative resection. We studied the relationship with 3-year disease-free survival(DFS)and 5-year survival rate(OS)., RESULTS: DFS and OS were 75.6% and 84.4%, respectively, and 81.3% and 69.6% for DFS and 82.4% and 84.4% for OS were in fStage II and III, respectively. Univariate analysis of DFS showed significant differences for sex, age, PNI, and NLR, but there was no difference in PS, location, adjuvant chemotherapy, CONUT, or mGPS. In multivariate analysis, sex(male)and NLR(>2)were independent prognostic factors(p=0.006 and p=0.01, respectively). As for OS, although significant differences were recognized for sex, age, PS, PNI, NLR, and CONUT, there was no difference in location, adjuvant chemotherapy, or mGPS. In multivariate analysis, PS(>=1)and NLR(>2)were independent prognostic factors(p=0.009 and p=0.006, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: NLR(>2)was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS among prognos- tic factors based on inflammation, nutrition, and immunity in fStage II/III colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score has been reported to correlate with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer prognosis, but the results remain inconsistent. This study was to synthetically determine the associations between CONUT score and prognosis in GI cancers., METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Embase, Google scholar, Wanfang and National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for eligible articles published prior to March 10, 2018. Pooled Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the prognostic potential of CONUT score in patients with GI cancers using Stata SE 12.0., RESULTS: A total of 9 articles comprising 2400 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, CONUT score greater than the cutoff predicted poor 5-year overall survival for patients with GI cancers (HR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.84-2.95, p<0.001) and 5-year cancer-specific survival (HR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.75-5.19, p<0.001). And patients with high CONUT score were at significantly greater risk of relapse/recurrence (HR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.30-1.98, p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: CONUT could be a noninvasive prognostic indicator that useful for predicting long-term survival in GI cancer patients after surgery.

AB  - Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score are useful for evaluating nutritional status, which is closely associated with cancer prognosis. This study compared the prognostic value of these indicators in patients with gastric cancer (GC) after radical gastrectomy (RG). We retrospectively enrolled 532 patients between 2010 and 2011. SMI was measured via CT images to determine low SMI. The CONUT score was calculated based on serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, and cholesterol. Patients were grouped according to SMI and the CONUT score based on previous research. Spearman's correlation coefficient, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression were used. There was no significant correlation between SMI and the CONUT score. Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with low SMI were significantly worse than those in patients with high SMI (P < .001). The normal nutrition group had better OS and RFS than did the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups (P < .05), but the OS and RFS were not significantly different between the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups (P = .726). Univariate analysis showed that SMI and the CONUT score were associated with OS and RFS, but only SMI remained prognostic in multivariate analysis. Preoperative SMI based on CT images is a more objective predictor than the CONUT score of long-term survival in GC after RG, but this finding must be confirmed by prospective trials.
