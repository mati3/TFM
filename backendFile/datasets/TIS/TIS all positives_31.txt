AB  - CONTEXT: - Patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia may display evidence of autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease. A recent European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society statement proposed research criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), which includes findings from the clinical, serologic, and morphologic domains., OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the importance of histopathologic criteria within the morphologic domain and to report our methodology for identifying these features., DESIGN: - Patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia at the University of Chicago who underwent surgical lung biopsy or lung transplantation were assessed for IPAF histopathologic features, using the initial pathology interpretation in the electronic records. A focused rereview of available slides by a pulmonary pathologist was then performed for patients who failed to meet IPAF criteria on initial pathology assessment., RESULTS: - Of 422 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 176 (41.7%) underwent surgical lung biopsy or lung transplant. Forty-six of those 176 patients (26.1%) met IPAF criteria by initial pathology interpretation and a positive clinical or serologic feature. Of the remaining 130 patients, 73 (56.2%) met either the clinical or serologic domains without meeting the morphologic domain, whereas 36 (27.7%) had slides available for pathology rereview. This rereview demonstrated nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in 8 of 36 patients (22.2%) and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in 6 of 36 patients (16.7%), resulting in an additional 7 of 36 patients (19.4%) with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that met the IPAF criteria. In IPAF, pulmonary vasculopathy was the most prevalent finding (45 of 84; 53.6%) and predicted increased mortality (hazard ratio, 2.5; P = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: - Using a methodological approach to identifying IPAF pathology, we demonstrate a significant increase in the number of patients meeting IPAF criteria because of focused pathologic review and highlight the prognostic value of the IPAF pathologic findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Activation of proteolytic mechanisms at the cell surface through the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) bound to its receptor, uPAR, is an important process in wound healing. The soluble forms of uPAR (suPAR and its fragments I, II, and III) have nonproteolytic functions that include chemotaxis, adhesion, and proliferation, which also have a role in wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine whether suPAR and its cleaved fragments are present in venous ulcers and whether their levels are associated with healing., METHODS: Ulcer exudates were collected from patients with venous leg ulcers (n = 30). Healing was defined as complete re-epithelialization within 6 months of compression therapy. Time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays were validated for quantification of suPAR and its fragments in ulcer exudates. The effect of exudates on keratinocyte migration was analyzed by an in vitro scratch assay., RESULTS: Ulcer exudates from patients who healed (n = 9) had approximately threefold higher levels of intact suPAR (P = .005), twofold higher levels of suPARI (P = .03), and approximately threefold higher levels suPARII-III (P < .0001) compared with nonhealers (n = 21). Exudate from healing ulcers stimulated keratinocyte migration (P = .02), whereas depletion of suPAR from exudates resulted in cell apoptosis., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that suPAR and its fragments are present in the environs of venous ulcers and may act as indicators of the propensity of venous ulcers to heal, with suPARII-III being the best discriminator. We speculate that suPAR and its fragments may have a role in the maintenance of an optimal ulcer-healing environment. Copyright © 2015 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has recently been defined by an international Taskforce to characterize interstitial lung disease associated with systemic manifestations limited to subtle serological and clinical autoimmune abnormalities and not fulfilling the international criteria for the diagnosis of a given connective tissue disease., OBJECTIVE: to report on a series of patients with IPAF, and to compare their outcome to that of a cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients in a single institution over a 3-year period., RESULTS: Out of 778 consecutive patients with interstitial lung disease, 55% had idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (including 20.1% with IPF), 21.5% had connective tissue disease, and 7.3% had IPAF. Patients (49% of females) had a mean FVC of 64% and a mean DLco of 49%. Serologic criteria for IPAF were the most frequent (93%), followed by "morphologic" criteria (79%), and clinical criteria (47%). Fifty three percent of patients had a NSIP pattern on CT. Nailfold capillaroscopy found giant capillaries in 13/30 patients tested (23%). No significant was found in overall survival between patients with IPAF and those with IPF., CONCLUSION: The recently defined criteria for IPAF are fulfilled by a significant proportion of patients referred for interstitial lung disease. As compared to those with IPF, patients with IPAF are more frequently females, have distinctive characteristics, have relatively frequent abnormalities at nailfold capillaroscopy, with no difference in age or in overall survival. Prospective studies are needed to guide the management of IPAF. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the CT findings and patterns of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and to assess whether imaging can predict survival for patients with IPAF., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 136 subjects who met the criteria for IPAF and had diagnostic-quality chest CT scans obtained from 2006 to 2015; a total of 74 of these subjects had pathologic samples available for review within 1 year of chest CT examination. CT findings and the presence of an usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern of disease were assessed, as was the UIP pattern noted on pathologic analysis. Analysis of chest CT findings associated with survival was performed using standard univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards methods as well as the unadjusted log-rank test. Survival data were visually presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimator., RESULTS: Most subjects with IPAF (57.4%; 78/136) had a high-confidence diagnosis of a UIP pattern on CT. Substantially fewer subjects (28.7%; 39/136) had a pattern that was inconsistent with UIP noted on CT. The presence of a UIP pattern on CT was associated with smoking (p < 0.01), male sex (p < 0.01), and older age (p < 0.001). Approximately one-fourth of the subjects had a nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis pattern on CT. Of interest, nearly one-tenth of the subjects had a CT pattern that was most consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than the customary CT patterns ascribed to lung disease resulting from connective tissue disease. Most subjects with a possible UIP pattern on CT (83.3%) had UIP diagnosed on the basis of pathologic findings. Focused multivariate analysis showed that honeycombing on CT (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.05-4.47) and pulmonary artery enlargement on CT (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.02-4.20) were independent predictors of survival., CONCLUSION: IPAF most often presents with a UIP pattern on CT and is associated with worse survival when concomitant honeycombing or pulmonary artery enlargement is present.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with autoimmune characteristics and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, particularly usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), do not fit neatly into the category of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), or recently proposed yet to be validated criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Outcomes of these patients are unknown., METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study. Analyses of variance compared differences in mean change in FVC and diffusion capacity (Dlco) over 1 year among 124 well-defined patients (20 patients with positive autoantibodies with or without symptoms of connective tissue disease [AI-ILD], 15 patients with IPAF, 36 patients with CTD-ILD, and 53 patients with IPF with negative CTD serologies [Lone-IPF])., RESULTS: Of the patients, 75% with AI-ILD, 33% with IPAF, and 33% with CTD-ILD had UIP. Initial FVC and Dlco were similarly moderately reduced across groups. Mean change in FVC over 12 months was as follows: -60 mL (IPAF), -110 mL (AI-ILD), -10 mL (CTD-ILD), and -90 mL (Lone-IPF) (P = .52). Mean change in Dlco was as follows: 2.39 mL/mm Hg/min (IPAF), -1.15 mL/mm Hg/min (AI-ILD), -0.27 mL/mm Hg/min (CTD-ILD), and -1.05 mL/mm Hg/min (Lone-IPF) (P < .001). By pattern of disease, the mean change in FVC was as follows: -140 mL (UIP), 10 mL (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia), and 12 mL (unclassifiable/other) (P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant differences in pulmonary function to distinguish between patients with AI-ILD, IPAF, CTD-ILD, and Lone-IPF were observed after 1 year. Longer periods of follow-up are needed to understand the outcomes of these patients. It is not yet clear whether AI-ILD is a distinct phenotype or a variant of the newly proposed entity IPAF.

AB  - To investigate the clinical features, risk factors and outcomes of patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). A total of 1429 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and undifferentiated connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (UCTD-ILD) were screened to identify patients who met IPAF criteria. Clinical, serological, and morphological features of patients with IPAF were characterized. Outcomes between patients with IPAF, UCTD-ILD, and IIP who were divided into idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF groups were compared using survival as an endpoint. Patients with IPAF were much common in young female and had lower percentage of ever smoking and a significantly shorter survival than those with non-IPAF (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that IPAF cohort survival was worse than that in non-IPF (P < 0.001), but better than that in IPF (P < 0.001). In IPAF cohort, the most common systemic symptom and serological abnormality were Raynaud's phenomenon (12.9%) and ANA >= 1:320 (49.2%); the most frequent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern was nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (61.6%). Multivariate analysis indicated that several factors including age, smoking history, organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern in HRCT, and anti-RNP positivity were independently associated with significantly worse survival. IPAF had the distinct clinical features and outcomes compared with other groups of ILD. Additional studies should be needed to explore the underlying autoimmune mechanism and to determine risk stratification in future clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aim of the study was to test lagged reciprocal effects of depressive symptoms and acute low back pain (LBP) across the first weeks of primary care., METHODS: In a prospective inception cohort study, 221 primary care patients with acute or subacute LBP were assessed at the time of initial consultation and then followed up at three and six weeks. Key measures were depressive symptoms (modified Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) and LBP (sensory pain, present pain index and visual analogue scale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire)., RESULTS: When only cross-lagged effects of six weeks were tested, a reciprocal positive relationship between LBP and depressive symptoms was shown in a cross-lagged structural equation model (beta = .15 and .17, p < .01). When lagged reciprocal paths at three- and six-week follow-up were tested, depressive symptoms at the time of consultation predicted higher LBP severity after three weeks (beta = .23, p < .01). LBP after three weeks had in turn a positive cross-lagged effect on depression after six weeks (beta = .27, p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Reciprocal effects of depressive symptoms and LBP seem to depend on time under medical treatment. Health practitioners should screen for and treat depressive symptoms at the first consultation to improve the LBP treatment.

AB  - Levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may influence wound healing and wound closure in non-healing wounds. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that hydrogencalcium salts of oxidized cellulose change the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and TNF-alpha, wound size and number of bacterial strains in non-healing wounds. We analyzed MMP-2, MMP-9 and TNF-alpha in the wound fluid from 20 patients by ELISA every fourteen days over six weeks. Wound size, pain, wound closure and bacterial strains in the wound were also investigated. The wound size was reduced in 14 patients and pain in 16 patients. Bacterial contamination of the wound decreased significantly after treatment. The level of MMP-2 correlated with TNF-alpha production. The level of MMP-9 was unchanged during the healing period. We conclude that hydrogencalcium salts of oxidized cellulose have a favorable effect on the reduction of bacterial contamination, wound size and pain.

AB  - Flaminal Forte is an enzyme alginogel,whose activity depends on the absorption and binding of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are known to play a crucial role in delayed wound healing. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of Flaminal on MMP-2/-9 activity in ulcer exudate, ex vivo. Eight patients with bilateral venous leg ulcers were treated for 4 weeks with Flaminal Forte covered by hydrocolloid ('F' wounds), or with hydrocolloid alone ('H' wounds) as a reference control. Clinical assessment did not reveal any differences between F and H wounds regarding surface reduction and general wound condition. Nevertheless, although non-significant, there was a visible difference in peri-wound skin appearance in F wounds, as compared to H wounds. The wound exudate contained high MMP-2/-9 levels, which gradually decreased as wounds healed. The attenuation of MMPs was stronger in F than in H exudate, however, in standard zymography this difference appeared non-significant. Real-time zymography revealed that Flaminal mediated a powerful direct inhibition of gelatinolytic activity of wound exudate and of recombinant MMP-2/-9 in vitro.

AB  - Leg ulcers present a common and recurring problem in older people creating discomfort and distress for the patient and a great cost to the health care services. Cultured keratinocyte grafts have been used by many investigators to stimulate healing of chronic venous ulcers. It has been proposed that they may do this by producing cytokines which modulate the healing process. However, the types and levels of cytokines in the leg ulcer fluid before and during healing are not known. Wound fluid was collected from venous leg ulcers in 18 patients beneath occlusive Tegaderm dressing for 4 to 6 h. The leg ulcers were divided on clinical criteria into 'healing' and 'non-healing'. PDGF-AB, GM-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and bFGF were measured by ELISA and the levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 were also measured using biological assays. The effect of leg ulcer wound fluid on fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation was measured indirectly by 3H-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay. Total protein, albumin levels, fibronectin degrading activity and collagenase activity, both active and latent were measured. No statistically significant differences in the levels of cytokines or collagenase were identified between healing and non-healing leg ulcers in the sample of leg ulcers studied. However, this study does give valuable information concerning the levels of cytokines and collagenase in chronic leg ulcer wound fluid.

AB  - Abnormally high levels of some proteases are associated with pathological changes in the wound bed of venous leg ulcers. This study involved two experiments which measured proteases in wound fluid harvested from leg ulcers in order to predict healing. In the first experiment, neutrophil elastase, a protease, was harvested from wound fluid extracted from the bandages of seven patients with leg ulcers. This was undertaken once a week over a period of up to six weeks. The amount of elastase recovered from the bandages showed wide variation between patients and there was no consistent correlation between the activity of elastase and healing of the ulcers, as determined nine months after sampling for the enzyme. The second experiment determined the stability of neutrophil elastase that was added to bandages for one week. The stability was found to vary from approximately 50% to 100%, depending on the type of bandage used. In addition to the possibility of using protease measurements to predict healing, the procedure was found to be simple, non-invasive and relatively inexpensive, and could be performed routinely in the clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify the prognostic factors for survival in patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) who meet the serological domain of the IPAF criteria., METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 99 IPAF patients who met the serological domain and were hospitalised at the Respiratory Medicine Unit of Kurashiki Central Hospital from 1999 to 2015. The high-resolution computed tomography findings were usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; n = 1), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 63), NSIP with organizing pneumonia (OP) overlap (n = 15), and OP (n = 20). One patient who had radiological UIP pattern, and met the serological and clinical domains was excluded. The clinical characteristics, radiological findings, administered therapy, and prognosis of the remaining 98 IPAF patients who met the serological and morphological domains were analysed., RESULTS: The median age of the 98 IPAF patients was 68 years, and 41 (41.8%) of them were men. Twelve (12.2%) of the 98 IPAF patients developed other characteristics and were diagnosed with connective tissue disease (CTD) later during the median follow-up of 4.5 years. Univariate Cox analysis revealed systemic sclerosis (SSc)-specific and SSc-associated antibodies (ANA nucleolar pattern, ANA centromere pattern, anti-ribonucleoprotein and anti-Scl-70) positive IPAF, radiological NSIP pattern, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lymphocytes >15%, and age as significant prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed radiological NSIP pattern (hazard ratio [HR], 4.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-15.77, p = 0.02) and age (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with worse survival., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that radiological NSIP pattern and age are poor prognostic factors for the survival of IPAF patients. This study suggested that the autoantibodies that are highly specific for certain connective tissue diseases might be less important for the prognosis of IPAF compared with the radiological-pathological patterns. The relatively high proportion of IPAF patients who developed CTD later suggests the importance of careful observation for evolution to CTD in IPAF.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the impaired healing of chronic leg ulcers but little direct evidence is available. We have observed a significant (p < 0.01) elevation of the allantoin : uric acid percentage ratio, a marker of oxidative stress, in wound fluid from chronic leg ulcers (median 17, range 8-860) compared to both paired plasma (median 2, range 1-8) and acute surgical wound fluid (median 4, range 3-7). However, the allantoin : uric acid percentage ratio did not differ significantly between chronic wounds that healed and those that failed to heal. Neutrophil elastase was elevated 30- to 1300-fold in chronic wound fluid compared to plasma and there was a correlation (r(2) = 0.742) between wound fluid elastase and the allantoin : uric acid percentage ratio. Total antioxidant capacity of wound fluid, as measured with a chemiluminescence assay, did not show a correlation (r(2) = 0.03) with the observed oxidative stress. These observations suggest that conditions of localized oxidative stress, possibly related to neutrophil-associated production of reactive oxygen species, are present in chronic leg ulcers. It is possible that future therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing oxidative stress, in addition to good standard care, could improve healing rates of chronic wounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) were recently established for research purposes in a joint statement from the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS). We reviewed the utility of these criteria in patients previously diagnosed as broadly defined undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) and noted overlapping IPAF findings. Additional review was given to IPAF patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on histopathology or radiology in terms of survival and outcome., METHODS: Patients with prior UCTD-interstitial lung disease (ILD) were screened by ERS/ATS criteria for IPAF. Clinical data along with all-cause mortality were collated and compared with selected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients from the same study period. Survival was compared between IPAF subgroups with and without UIP features., RESULTS: One hundred and one UCTD-ILD subjects (91%) evaluated from 2005 to 2012 also met strict criteria for IPAF. Frequent clinical findings included Raynaud's phenomenon, positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern on chest computed tomography (CT). Nineteen had features of UIP either on histopathology or CT imaging. As compared with IPF, IPAF patients had overall better survival except in those with UIP features., CONCLUSION: Current IPAF criteria encompassed the majority of broadly defined UCTD-ILD and included those with UIP findings. Survival compared with IPF in those with UIP was similar. Further studies are necessary to refine IPAF definitions for clinical use and guide directed management strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) with autoimmune features that does not fulfil connective tissue disease (CTD) criteria has been recently defined as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). However, its long-term clinical course and outcome are poorly understood., METHODS: We included consecutive patients diagnosed with IIP (n = 586) or CTD-related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD, n = 149). Some patients with IIP were reclassified as IPAF based on recent guidelines., RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 45 months. Among the IIP patients, 109 (18.6%) were reclassified as IPAF. Compared to the non-IPAF-IIP group, the IPAF group had slower diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO ) and total lung capacity declines, and more frequent CTD development during follow-up periods. The prognosis of the IPAF was better than that of the non-IPAF-IIP and similar to that of the CTD-ILD. IPAF was associated with better prognosis in the IIP cohort on univariate but not on multivariate analysis. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, old age and low DLCO independently predicted mortality in the IPAF group., CONCLUSION: Compared to the non-IPAF-IIP group, the IPAF group had slower lung function declines and more frequent CTD development during follow-up. Although the prognosis of IPAF group was better than that of non-IPAF-IIP group and similar to that of CTD-ILD group, it showed poor prognosis in patients with old age, UIP pattern, and low DLCO .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who show features related to autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease are categorized as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). The present study compared clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with IPAF to patients with connective tissue disease related-interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., METHODS: ILD patients who were consecutively enrolled in a single institution ILD cohort between 2008 and 2015 were evaluated for the study. Clinical data had been prospectively collected, while radiologic imaging and pathologic findings were re-reviewed for the present study., RESULTS: Out of 305 patients with ILD, 54 (17.7%) patients met the classification of IPAF, 175 (57.4%) patients had IPF, and 76 (24.9%) patients were diagnosed with CTD-ILD. Compared to IPF, incidences of acute exacerbations in 1,3 and 5 years were significantly less in the IPAF group (p = 0.022, p = 0.026 and p = 0.007, respectively). From multivariate analysis for mortality, age (p = 0.034, HR 1.022, 95% CI: 1.002-1.044), FVC (p < 0.001, HR 0.970, 95% CI: 0.955-0.984), ILD exacerbation (p = 0.001, HR 2.074, 95% CI: 1.366-3.148), and ILD type (p = 0.047, HR 0.436, 95% CI: 0.192-0.984 (IPAF vs IPF), respectively) showed significant association., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the other ILD groups, IPAF showed distinct clinical characteristics. The IPAF group showed better survival and less episodes of exacerbation when compared to the IPF group.

AB  - Chronic wounds are a significant socio-economic problem, thus, the improvement of the effectiveness of their treatment is an important objective for public health strategies. The predominant stage of the chronic wound is the inflammatory reaction which is associated with the damage of tissues, possibly due to the excessive secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Several reports have suggested that amnion dressing inhibits tissue destruction and accelerates wound healing. Our recent study revealed that sterilized amnion stimulates keratinocyte proliferation in vitro, while the present study focused on the clinical application of radiation-sterilized amnion in chronic venous leg ulcers and aimed to explain the possible mechanism of its in vivo action. The study involved 25 individuals suffering from venous leg ulceration with a surface area of 10-100 cm2 and a healing rate below 10% per week, as verified during a 2-week screening period. The effectiveness of the amnion dressing was estimated following 4 weeks of treatment. The wound assessment, based on a modified Bates-Jensen Questionnaire, revealed a good and satisfactory response to the treatment in 23 of the 25 patients. The measurement of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in wound exudates revealed a decrease in activity in response to amnion application. This effect resulted from the presence of the potent MMP inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the amnion dressings, as shown by real-time fluorescence zymography and protein microarrays. Thus, unlike modern synthetic dressing materials, radiation-sterilized amnion dressings may have a multidirectional beneficial effect on chronic wounds.

AB  - Sustained high levels of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and PMN-derived proteases in the microenvironment of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLUs) are linked to chronic inflammation and delayed healing. Uncontrolled PMN activity eventually destroys newly developed tissue and degrades critical growth factors. The bioactive components of fish oil (n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) have strong inflammation-resolving actions and have been shown to assuage PMN activity, but have not been tested in CVLU patients. This randomized controlled study compared the effectiveness of oral EPA + DHA therapy to a placebo for reducing PMN activation in CVLU microenvironments. At Days 0, 28, and 56, markers of PMNs (CD15) and activated PMNs (CD66b), and levels of PMN-derived proteases human neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-8 were measured in CVLU fluid from patients receiving standard compression therapy and (1) EPA + DHA therapy (n = 16) or (2) placebo (n = 19). By Day 56, the EPA + DHA Group had a significantly lower percentage of CD66b+ cells in CVLU fluid compared to Day 0 (p = 0.02) and to Day 28 (p = 0.05). Importantly, there were downward trends in levels of both matrix metalloproteinase-8 and human neutrophil elastase over time in the EPA + DHA Group, which also demonstrated greater reductions in wound area by Day 28 (57% reduction) and Day 56 (76% reduction) than the Control Group (35% and 59%, respectively). Moreover, reductions in wound area had significant negative relationships with CD15+ cells in wound fluid at Days 28 (p = 0.008) and 56 (p < 0.001), and CD66b+ cells at Days 28 (p = 0.04) and 56 (p = 0.009). The collective findings provide supplemental evidence that high levels of activated PMNs in CVLU microenvironments inhibit healing, and suggest that EPA + DHA oral therapy may modulate PMN activity and facilitate healing of CVLUs when added to standard care regimens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe the clinical manifestations and survival of patients with ILD and myositis-specific and associated autoantibodies, and to evaluate the performance of the new ATS/ERS classification criteria for IPAF., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ILD and positive in at least one of the following autoantibodies: anti-Jo-1, anti-Ej, anti-PL7, anti-PL 12, anti-PM/SCL 75 and anti-PM/SCL100 were included. Patients were separated into three groups according to their autoantibody profile: 1. Jo-1 positive patients, 2. Non-Jo-1 antisynthetase autoantibody positive patients, and 3. PM/SCL positive patients. Relevant clinical characteristics were registered. Patients were evaluated had they fulfilled Bohan and Peter's criteria (BPC) for inflammatory myopathies. We evaluated the performance of the IPAF ATS/ERS proposal to classify as such the patients that did not fulfilled BPC, and evaluated whether IPAF patients had a worse survival that BPC patients., RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included. Jo-1 was the most frequent autoantibody (65%), followed by non Jo1 anti-synthetase autoantibodies (31%). Non-Jo1 patients had lower Creatin Kinase serum levels at the baseline and less frequency of arthritis. Only 50% of patients fulfilled BPC. All patients not complying with BPC did comply with IPAF criteria. There was no difference in survival between IPAF and BPC patients. Anti Jo-1 positive was associated to survival and the extent of lung inflammation was associated to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Patients differ in clinical manifestations according to the autoantibody profile. All patients not complying with BPC did comply with the new IPAF criteria. There was no difference in survival between BPC and IPAF patients. Jo-1 patients had a better survival. Extent of lung inflammation was associate to mortality. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Little is known about the course of recovery of acute low back pain (LBP) patients as a function of depression. In a prospective study, 286 acute LBP patients were assessed at baseline and followed up over 6 months. Recovery was defined as improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was employed with ODI as repeated factor, age, sex, and body mass index as covariates, depression and all other potential prognostic factors as between-subject factors. Of study participants, 18% were classified as depressive (>33 points on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale). Of 286 participants, 135 were lost to follow-up. In the longitudinal sample of 151 patients the course of recovery was slower in depressive patients. Depression was associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be included in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to identify those at risk of delayed recovery at an early stage.

AB  - This study examines predictors of sickness absence in patients presenting to a health practitioner with acute/ subacute low back pain (LBP). Aims of this study were to identify baseline-variables that detect patients with a new LBP episode at risk of sickness absence and to identify prognostic models for sickness absence at different time points after initial presentation. Prospective cohort study investigating 310 patients presenting to a health practitioner with a new episode of LBP at baseline, three-, six-, twelve-week and six-month follow-up, addressing work-related, psychological and biomedical factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify baseline-predictors of sickness absence at different time points. Prognostic models comprised 'job control', 'depression' and 'functional limitation' as predictive baseline-factors of sickness absence at three and six-week follow-up with 'job control' being the best single predictor (OR 0.47; 95%CI 0.26-0.87). The six-week model explained 47% of variance of sickness absence at six-week follow-up (p<0.001). The prediction of sickness absence beyond six-weeks is limited, and health practitioners should re-assess patients at six weeks, especially if they have previously been identified as at risk of sickness absence. This would allow timely intervention with measures designed to reduce the likelihood of prolonged sickness absence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alteration in the expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP-2) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-AA) may contribute to poor healing in venous leg ulcers., AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the expression of EMMPRIN, MMP-2, TIMP-2 and PDGF-AA in the ulcer exudates and perivascular tissue of healing and non-healing chronic venous ulcers., PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with chronic venous ulcers were included in this study, with a mean age of 60 years. Eleven patients were males and 29 were females. All patients had normal ankle brachial index and a venous ulcer of at least 8 weeks duration. Immuno-histochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to PDGF-AA, MMP-2, TIMP-2 and EMMPRIN was carried out on paraffin embedded punch biopsy skin specimens from the ulcer edge. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for PDGF, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were carried out on wound fluids collected from patients. The ulcer size and character at the initial assessment and after 8 weeks were assessed to determine the status of ulcer healing., RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the expression of TIMP-2, MMP-2 and EMMPRIN between the two groups. However, in the non-healing group high levels of MMP-2 and low levels of TIMP-2 in the wound fluid suggest a strong correlation of these two markers in the state of healing. Analysis of wound fluid by ELISA demonstrated high PDGF-AA in the healing group (p = 0.021). Significantly increased levels of PDGF-AA (p<0001) was noted in the perivascular area on immuno-histochemistry of healing ulcers. These data suggest that PDGF-AA plays an important role in healing of venous ulcers., CONCLUSION: Non-healing venous ulcers are associated with greater activity MMP-2 activity. The ratio of MMPs to their inhibitors TIMPs, dictate the rate of healing of the ulcers. PDGF-AA activity is associated with ulcer healing, though the mechanism is unclear. EMMPRIN expression in chronic venous ulcers probably parallels the chronicity of the condition rather than propagate it. However, further studies with larger samples are needed.

AB  - Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) may have features of connective tissue disease (CTD), but lack findings diagnostic of a specific CTD. A recent European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society research statement proposed criteria for patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). We applied IPAF criteria to patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and undifferentiated CTD-ILD (UCTD). We then characterised the clinical, serological and morphological features of the IPAF cohort, compared outcomes to other ILD cohorts and validated individual IPAF domains using survival as an endpoint.Of 422 patients, 144 met IPAF criteria. Mean age was 63.2 years with a slight female predominance. IPAF cohort survival was marginally better than patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but worse than CTD-ILD. A non-usual interstitial pneumonia pattern was associated with improved survival, as was presence of the clinical domain. A modified IPAF cohort of those meeting the clinical domain and a radiographic or histological feature within the morphological domain displayed survival similar to those with CTD-ILD.IPAF is common among patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and UCTD. Specific IPAF features can identify subgroups with differential survival. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and determine whether patients meeting IPAF criteria benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. Copyright ©ERS 2016.

AB  - Venous ulcers are related to dysfunctions in extracellular matrix. Both matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) could play a role in the healing process in patients with chronic venous ulcers. We evaluated the role of MMP-9 and NGAL in the healing process in venous ulceration. We performed an open-label, parallel groups, single clinical center study. Patients with chronic venous leg ulcers represented the test group (Group I), whereas patients without chronic ulcers represented the control group (Group II). In Group I plasma and wound fluid samples were collected at the time of admission, at the time of the surgery, and at the follow-up, while ulcer tissues were taken at the time of the surgery. In Group II, plasma and wound fluid were collected at admission and at the time of the surgery, whereas skin tissues were collected at the time of the surgery. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was used to evaluate the levels of MMP-9 and NGAL in plasma and wound fluid, whereas Western blot analysis was performed to estimate the expression of MMP-9 and NGAL in tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significantly higher levels of MMP-9 and NGAL in both plasma and wound fluid of patients with ulcers compared to patients without ulcers (p < 0.01). Moreover, Western blot analysis documented an increased expression of MMP-9 and NGAL in biopsy tissue of patients with ulcers compared to patients without ulcers (p < 0.01). In conclusion MMP-9 and NGAL may correlate with the clinical course of venous ulcers. Copyright © 2013 by the Wound Healing Society.

AB  - Venous ulcers are common, with an overall prevalence of up to 2% in the general population of western countries, and have significant socioeconomic impact. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the alteration of extracellular matrix that could lead to venous ulceration. Sixty-four patients with venous ulcers were recruited in a 22-month period. All patients were subjected to the most appropriate treatment considering also the patient's wishes (compression therapy followed or not by vein surgery). Patients were randomised into two groups of 32 persons in each (groups A and B). Patients of group A in addition to the basic treatment, described above, received the administration of oral low doses of doxycycline 20 mg b.i.d. for 3 months, whereas patients of group B received basic treatment only. Healing was assessed by means of direct ulcer tracing with computerised planimetry. Group A showed a higher healing rate compared with group B. In group B, the lower healing rate was related to higher levels of MMP-9; neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and vascular endothelial growth factor, documented in plasma; wound fluid and biopsies executed and compared between both groups. Pharmacological treatments, as doxycycline administration, which by means of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, through the inhibition of MMP, could improve extracellular matrix functioning and represent a possible solution to support wound healing.

AB  - Oxidised regenerated cellulose/collagen matrix (ORC/collagen matrix) modifies wound microenvironments by binding and inactivating excess levels of proteases such as elastase, plasmin and gelatinases in wound exudates. To compare levels of the gelatinases matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), elastase and plasmin in wound exudates collected from chronic venous insufficiency patients with venous leg ulcers treated with either an ORC/collagen matrix or a standard control therapy. During a 12-week treatment period, wound exudate samples were obtained from a control group of 10 patients treated with a hydrocolloid dressing and a treatment group of 17 patients treated with a combination of ORC/collagen matrix and hydrocolloid dressing. On admission and days 5, 14 and every subsequent 14th day, ulcers were photographed to determine healing rate and changes in ulcer appearance, and MMP-2 concentration and the gelatinase, elastase and plasmin activities were analysed from wound exudates. The patients treated with ORC/collagen matrix showed a significant decrease in elastase, plasmin and gelastinase activity as compared with the control group, with no significant difference in the MMP-2 concentrations between the two groups. The results show a significant and immediate reduction in protease activity in wound exudates from venous leg ulcers treated with ORC/collagen.

AB  - To assess the differences in proteolytic activity of acute and chronic wound environments, wound fluids were collected from acute surgical wounds (22 samples) and chronic wounds (25 samples) of various etiologies, including mixed vessel disease ulcers, decubiti and diabetic foot ulcers. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity measured using the Azocoll assay was significantly elevated by 30 fold in chronic wounds (median 22.8 microg MMP Eq/ml) compared to acute wounds (median 0.76 microg MMP Eq/ml) (p < 0.001). The addition of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor Illomostat decreased the matrix metalloproteinase activity by approximately 90% in all samples, confirming that the majority of the activity measured was due to matrix metalloproteinases. Gelatin zymograms indicated predominantly elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 with smaller elevations of matrix metalloproteinase-2. In addition tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels were analyzed in a small subset of acute and chronic wounds. When tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels were compared to protease levels there was an inverse correlation (p = 0.02, r = - 0.78). In vitro degradation of epidermal growth factor was measured by addition of 125I labelled epidermal growth factor to acute and chronic wound fluid samples. There was significantly higher degradation of epidermal growth factor in chronic wound fluid samples (mean 28.1%) compared to acute samples (mean 0.6%). This also correlated to the epidermal growth factor activity of these wound fluid samples (p < 0. 001, r = 0.64). Additionally, the levels of proteases were assayed in wound fluid collected from 15 venous leg ulcers during a nonhealing and healing phase using a unique model of chronic wound healing in humans. Patients with nonhealing venous leg ulcers were admitted to the hospital for bed rest and wound fluid samples were collected on admission (nonhealing phase) and after 2 weeks (healing phase) when the ulcers had begun to heal as evidenced by a reduction in size (median 12%). These data showed that the elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase activity decreased significantly as healing occurs in chronic leg ulcers (p < 0.01). This parallels the processes observed in normally healing acute wounds. This data also supports the case for the addition of protease inhibitors in chronic wounds in conjunction with any treatments using growth factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge on the underlying mechanisms for nonhealing chronic wounds is fragmentary., OBJECTIVES: To increase our understanding of the pathogenesis, the relationship between healing ability and a large panel of proteins was studied using a specially designed wound-healing antibody-based microarray., METHODS: Wound fluid from nondiabetic patients with nonhealing venous leg ulcers was compared with that from patients with healing open granulating acute wounds. The high-throughput method enabled simultaneous measurement of the relative levels of 48 different proteins representing major categories of wound-healing modulators., RESULTS: Unexpectedly, several of the examined proteins, including various proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases and antiproteinases, were not significantly (P>0.001) changed in chronic wound fluid. For example, levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and one of its substrates type IV collagen were similar in the two groups. The wound fluid samples displayed similar degrees of fragmentation of fibronectin by Western blot analysis and the total fibronectin levels were doubled (P<0.001) in chronic compared with acute wounds. The increased fibronectin originated from alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts and not from the circulation. S100A8/A9 was the sole protein that was reduced (P<0.001) in wound fluid from venous ulcers [median 226 mug mL(-1) (interquartile range 213-278)] compared with healing wounds [455 mug mL(-1) (382-504)], probably reflecting a difference in inflammatory cell composition., CONCLUSION: The molecular anomalies in chronic wounds are more subtle than the current paradigm and neither excessive proteinase activity nor deficiencies of examined extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors or angiogenic/angiostatic factors appear to contribute significantly to the nonhealing state of venous leg ulcers.

AB  - The plasminogen activator/plasmin system is known to initiate a proteolytic cascade resulting in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases in vitro leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix. To investigate whether or not this cascade is present during delayed wound healing and contributes to the pathophysiological basis of impaired healing we examined the temporal expression of urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and gelatinase-B in fluid collected from chronic venous leg ulcers compared to acute surgical mastectomy wounds. Using a chromogenic substrate assay, levels of active urokinase plasminogen activator in chronic wounds were found to be about five fold higher compared to sera and two fold higher compared to mastectomy wounds. Levels of active plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in chronic wounds were four times higher than those found in sera and two times higher than those found in mastectomy wound fluid. Using a fibrin overlay system and reverse zymography, we found that when the wound was not healing, the expression of urokinase plasminogen activator in chronic wound fluid was initially detected in the active forms (50 and 33 kDa), but that as the wound healed and decreased in size, was detected as an inhibitor- bound urokinase plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex ( congruent with 80-116 kDa). When the expression of active urokinase plasminogen activator was highest, no plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was detectable. In contrast, urokinase plasminogen activator was always detected in the inhibitor bound form as a urokinase plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex in blood- and plasma-derived serum and mastectomy wound fluid. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was detected in blood-derived serum and mastectomy wound fluid but not in plasma derived serum. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in chronic wound fluids, analyzed by gelatin zymography, showed that when urokinase plasminogen activator was detected in the active forms, matrix metalloproteinase-9 was overexpressed by approximately twice that found in mastectomy wounds and approximately 30 times that detected in blood-derived sera. When urokinase plasminogen activator appeared almost entirely as an enzyme- inhibitor complex, the level of expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was similar to that seen in mastectomy wound fluid. We conclude that the switch in urokinase plasminogen activator expression from an active to inhibitor bound form correlates with the decrease seen in matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression suggesting the presence of a proteolytic cascade initiated by the plasminogen activator/plasmin system during wound healing leading to the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9. In addition, expression of urokinase plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase-9 appear to be useful biomarkers to determine clinical wound healing status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases are heterogeneous, and patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia (CFIP) often have clinical, serologic, and morphologic features suggestive but not diagnostic of connective tissue disease. Recently, the concept of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has been proposed as a platform for such patients. However, the prognostic role of IPAF, including the cumulative incidence of acute exacerbations (AEs), is not fully clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features and prognostic significance of IPAF., METHODS: The clinical characteristics and prognostic relevance of a diagnosis of IPAF were retrospectively explored in 194 patients with CFIP, including 163 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 31 with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), in our interstitial lung disease database., RESULTS: Sixteen percent of patients with CFIP (8% of IPF, 61% of NSIP) met the criteria for IPAF. Patients with IPAF were significantly younger and included a higher proportion of women, never-smokers, and patients with NSIP than those without IPAF. The morphologic domain was the most common in patients with IPAF (97%), followed by the serologic domain (72%) and clinical domain (53%). CFIP patients with IPAF had a more favorable prognosis with regard to overall survival (OS; P<0.001, log-rank test) and incidence of AEs (P=0.029, Gray's test) than those without IPAF. In the subgroup analysis, NSIP patients with IPAF had significantly better survival than those without IPAF (P=0.031, log-rank test), and IPF patients with IPAF tended to have better OS than those without IPAF (P=0.092, log-rank test). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs between patients with IPAF and those without IPAF in the IPF and NSIP subgroups. Furthermore, fulfilment of the IPAF criteria was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.127; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.017-0.952; P=0.045) and incidence of AEs (HR 0.225: 95% CI 0.054-0.937; P=0.040)., CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of IPAF might predict a favorable prognosis and less risk of AEs in patients with CFIP.
