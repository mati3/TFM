AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory myopathies (such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis) are well-recognized paraneoplastic syndromes. However, paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy is a more recently defined clinical entity, characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical, predominantly proximal muscle weakness with severe disability, and associated with a marked increase in serum muscle enzyme levels. Paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy requires muscle biopsy for diagnosis, which typically shows massive necrosis of muscle fibers with limited or absent inflammatory infiltrates., CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an 82-year-old Italian-born Caucasian man who was admitted to hospital because of heart failure and two drop attacks. Over the following days, he developed progressive severe weakness, dysphagia, and dysphonia. Testing showed increasing serum muscle enzyme levels. Electromyography showed irritative myopathy of the proximal muscles and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy (left vastus lateralis) showed massive necrosis of muscle fibers with negligible inflammatory infiltrates, complement membrane attack complex deposition on endomysial capillaries, and moderate upregulation of major histocompatibility complex-I. Computed tomography of the thorax showed a nodular mass in the apex of the right lung. The patient was diagnosed with paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy. In spite of high-dose corticoid therapy, he died 1 month later because of his aggressive cancer. Subsequent electron microscopic examination of a muscle biopsy specimen showed thickened walls and typical pipestem changes of the endomysial capillaries, with swollen endothelial cells. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung was confirmed on post-mortem histological examination., CONCLUSIONS: Paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy is a rare syndrome with outcomes ranging from fast progression to complete recovery. Treatment with corticosteroids is often ineffective, and prognosis depends mainly on the characteristics of the underlying cancer. This case shows that paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy may have an atypical appearance, and should be considered in elderly patients with neoplastic disease. In this case, the diagnosis was delayed by the unusual clinical picture that suggested heart disease rather than muscle disease.

AB  - Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of acquired immune-mediated diseases, which typically involve the striated muscle with a variable involvement of the skin and other organs. Clinically, they are characterized by proximal muscle weakness, elevation of muscle enzymes, myopathic changes on electromyography and an abnormal muscle biopsy. The different IIM have been classified according to their distinctive histopathologic features in dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), inclusion body myositis (IBM) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Several myositis-specific antibodies are associated with the different phenotypes, as well as with different risk of neoplastic disease and systemic complications. The basis for the treatment of DM, PM, and IMNM is immunosuppression. For IBM there are only symptomatic treatments. Steroids, associated or not with other immunosuppressant drugs, are the first line of treatment. Biologic drugs will allow future individualized therapies. The 10-year survival of DM, PM and IMNM is 62 to 90%. The leading causes of death are neoplastic, lung and cardiac complications. IBM does not impair survival, although it affects the quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A BRAF V600E mutation is found as driver oncogene in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Although combined treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib is highly effective, the efficacy of reduced doses of the drugs in combination therapy has not yet been reported., CASE PRESENTATION: A Japanese man in his mid-sixties was diagnosed with unresectable lung adenocarcinoma and was unresponsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected by next generation sequencing, and the patient was subjected to treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib in combination. Although the treatment reduced the tumor size, he experienced myalgia and muscle weakness with elevated serum creatine kinase and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis induced by dabrafenib and trametinib. After the patient recovered from rhabdomyolysis, the treatment doses of dabrafenib and trametinib were reduced, which prevented further rhabdomyolysis and maintained tumor shrinkage., CONCLUSION: The reduction of the doses of dabrafenib and trametinib was effective in the treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant NSCLC, and also prevented the incidence of rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - There are several key observations on paraneoplastic myopathies: The risk of cancer associated with DM is very high, whereas risk of cancer associated with PM is mildly increased Most cancers develop within one year of the onset of myositis, although the risk remains high up to 5 years after diagnosis. The most common cancers associated with DM are adenocarcinoma, including lung, ovary, cervical, stomach, pancreas, colorectal and lymphoma, whereas PM is associated with a high risk of lymphoma. The clinical course of myopathy is closely linked with the course of cancer. Certain clinical features are associated with CAM including severe treatment resistant skin manifestations, severe muscle weakness, respiratory muscle weakness, and dysphagia, while some clinical features are protective such as arthritis, Raynaud, and ILD. Screening should be based on age, gender, ethnicity, and the geographic area of the patient; however, certain high-risk patients may require more extensive screening including tumor markers and thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT scans. Certain autoantibodies including anti-p155 and the absence of more common autoantibodies are associated with a higher risk of CAM, while the presence of antisynthetase autoantibodies lowers the risk for CAM. Although the pathogenesis of CAM is unclear, a plausible hypothesis is that immune responses generated against antigens commonly targeted in myositis are related to antitumor responses in affected individuals.

AB  - We present a case of a 59-year-old male with a confirmed diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). He had progressive disease even after four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy and 21 cycles of radiation. He was therefore started on immunotherapy with nivolumab every 2 weeks and ipilimumab every 6 weeks. After 4 months of starting immunotherapy, he reported extreme fatigue, muscular weakness, and poor appetite. He was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, primary adrenal insufficiency, and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). LEMS can be both a paraneoplastic syndrome of SCLC and an adverse effect of immunotherapy. Currently, there is no diagnostic test available to determine if a case of LEMS is a paraneoplastic syndrome or immunotherapy-related adverse effect. In our patient, we felt that LEMS was an immunotherapy-related adverse effect rather being a paraneoplastic syndrome. Our determination was based on the time of onset of muscular weakness, presence of other immunotherapy-mediated adverse events, and the appearance of symptoms in spite of SCLC that had been stabilized on immunotherapy. Accordingly, immunotherapy was stopped and a brief tapering course of steroids was initiated. Our patient's muscular weakness from LEMS responded well. His clinical improvement persisted even with radiologic progression of disease after cessation of immunotherapy.

AB  - Skin may show the first clinical evidence of systemic disease and can be the first clue to malignancy in 1% of cases. Dermatomyositis is an immunologically mediated inflammatory myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness, muscle inflammation, and characteristic skin findings. It has an incidence of 1 in 100,000 patients. In 15%-30% cases of dermatomyositis, an underlying malignancy is the cause of paraneoplastic syndrome. Ovarian and breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men are the most common malignancies associated with dermatomyositis. Here we report the case of a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman who initially presented with a facial rash. She was treated for chemical dermatitis without resolution of symptoms and was subsequently found to have dermatomyositis associated with stage IV invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. In most cases, the skin changes resolve after treatment for the underlying malignancy has been initiated, but in this case of paraneoplastic dermatomyositis, the rash worsened with initiation of treatment for underlying breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trofosfamide is increasingly used in the treatment of patients with several types of malignancies. However, the optimal dose of trofosfamide for patients with advanced cancer has not been systematically investigated yet. The aim of this study was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous oral trofosfamide., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 16 patients with advanced lung cancer (14 nonsmall cell lung cancer, 2 small cell lung cancer; 10 male, 6 female; median age 64 years (range 46-82); median Karnofsky status 70%; median number of organs involved 3 (range 1-6)) were enrolled. All patients were previously treated with chemotherapy (median 2x, range 1-6) and 8/16 (50%) with radiotherapy. Patients received trofosfamide p.o. administered in 3 doses per day for 3 weeks (1 cycle) using a 3-patient-cohort dose-escalation strategy. Toxicities were graded according to the WHO Criteria., RESULTS: Patients received a median of 2 cycles of trofosfamide (range 1-4) at 3 dose levels (90, 125, and 175 mg/m2). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 20, 13.3, and 6.6%, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle were grade 3 muscle weakness and anorexia observed in 1/6 patients in cohort 1 (trofosfamide 90 mg/m2), grade 3 neutropenia in 1/6, and encephalopathy in 1/6 patients in cohort 3 (trofosfamide 175 mg/m2). Therefore, the dose level of 125 mg/m2 was defined as the MTD., CONCLUSION: Trofosfamide at 125 mg/m2 administered in 3 doses per day was well tolerated. This dose level is recommended for further clinical studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ectopic Cushing syndrome is a form of Cushing's in which a tumor outside the pituitary gland produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Small cell carcinoma and carcinoid of the lung comprises half of its cases. The main purpose of this study is to present a case of ectopic Cushing syndrome caused by a hidden lung carcinoid and how to manage it., PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we present a case of a 26year old young male complains of increased weight and appetite, proximal muscle weakness, easy bruising and appearing of purple striae on his abdomen, with a final diagnosis of ACTH secreting lung carcinoid., DISCUSSION: The diagnosis was made by non-invasive radiological procedures (CT scan and MRI) and serological tests. The management consisted of medical treatment which was not useful, then bilateral adrenalectomy to limit the patient symptoms. The ectopic spot was finally detected and excised surgically through thoracotomy. After six months of follow up there was no recurrence, signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome begin to disappear., CONCLUSION: Ectopic cushing syndrome is a complicated medical problem especially when it comes to identification of the ectopic spot. The surgical treatment could be curative when the spot is determined. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sucrose nonfermenting AMPK-related kinase (SNARK) is a member of the AMPK family of kinases and has been implicated in the regulation of critical metabolic processes. Recent findings demonstrate that SNARK has an important role in the maintenance of muscle mass with age. Loss of skeletal muscle mass (cachexia) is a key problem for cancer patients. Thus, based on our previous findings with aging, we hypothesized that SNARK would play a role in regulating muscle mass under conditions of cancer cachexia. To test this hypothesis, Lewis Lung Carcinoma tumor cells or vehicle were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of wild type mice, muscle-specific transgenic mice expressing inactive SNARK mutant (SDN) or muscle-specific transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type SNARK (SWT). All tumor-bearing mice presented muscle wasting compared to vehicle-injected mice. However, SDN tumor-bearing mice had more pronounced atrophy compared to wild-type and SWT tumor-bearing mice. Histological analysis confirmed muscle atrophy in tumor-bearing mice, and SDN tumor-bearing mice exhibited a significantly smaller skeletal muscle cross-sectional area than wild-type and SWT tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, SDN tumor-bearing mice had increased skeletal muscle BAX protein expression, a marker of apoptosis, compared to other groups.Thus, lack of SNARK in skeletal muscle aggravates cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. These findings uncover a role for SNARK in the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass under cachexia conditions. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights reserved.

AB  - In superior vena cava occlusion, multiple collateral pathways develop to maintain venous drainage. Major patterns and pathways of venous collateral blood flow are well described, but rarely in complete chronic superior vena cava occlusion secondary to malignancy. A 59-year-old man with facial and upper extremity edema had a severely compressed superior vena cava at the initial diagnosis of stage IV mediastinal lung adenocarcinoma. The occlusion of superior vena cava progressed. After 10 months of treatment, the complete occlusion led to mild symptoms of hoarseness, muscle weakness, cough, and slight upper extremity edema. Venography clearly illustrated well-developed venous collateral blood flow through lateral thoracic, azygos-hemiazygos, and vertebral collateral venous pathways classified as Stanford type IV. The patient survived for a total of 20 months. He maintained Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1-2 until 2 months before death without severe symptoms of superior vena cava occlusion. This case described a rarely occurring venographic demonstration of well-developed Stanford type IV collateral pathway. Moreover, even with complete superior vena cava occlusion, well-developed Stanford type IV lateral thoracic collateral pathway can compensate for the venous flow without deterioration of performance status for a long period in certain cases.

AB  - Association between cancer and myositis has been extensively reported and malignancy is a potentially life-threating complication in myositis. In this retrospective study authors give an overview of Hungarian cancer-associated myositis (CAM) patients treated at a single centre managing 450 myositis patients. All patients were diagnosed according to Bohan and Peter. Statistical analysis of disease onset, age, sex, muscle, skin and extramuscular symptoms, muscle enzymes, presence of antibodies, treatment and prognosis was performed. 43 patients could be considered as having CAM. 83.72% had cancer within one year of diagnosis of myositis. Most common localizations were ductal carcinoma of breast and adenocarcinoma of lung. Significant differences were observed between CAM and the non-CAM control patients: DM:PM ratio was 2.31:1 vs. 0.87:1, respectively (p = 0.029), age at diagnosis was 56.60 +/- 12.79 vs. 38.88 +/- 10.88 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Tumour-treatment was the following: surgical removal in 55.81%, chemotherapy in 51.1%, radiotherapy in 39.53%, hormone treatment in 18.6%, combination therapy in 51.16% of patients. Muscle enzyme levels of patients undergoing surgery were significantly reduced after intervention. 36 patients died (83.72%); 25 DM (83.33%) and 11 PM patients (84.62%); 5 years survival was 15.4% for PM and 27.5% for DM. This study demonstrates that DM, distal muscle weakness, asymmetric Raynaud's phenomenon, older age, ANA-negativity are risk factors for developing malignancy and polymyositis patients have less chance of long-lasting survival. It is very important to think about cancer and follow every single myositis patient in the clinical routine because survival rate of CAM is very poor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of muscle mass worsens many diseases such as cancer and renal failure, contributes to the frailty syndrome, and is associated with an increased risk of death. Studies conducted on animal models have revealed the preponderant role of muscle proteolysis and in particular the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Studies conducted in humans remain scarce, especially within renal deficiency. Whether a shared atrophying programme exists independently of the nature of the disease remains to be established. The aim of this work was to identify common modifications at the transcriptomic level or the proteomic level in atrophying skeletal muscles from cancer and renal failure patients., METHODS: Muscle biopsies were performed during scheduled interventions in early-stage (no treatment and no detectable muscle loss) lung cancer (LC), chronic haemodialysis (HD), or healthy (CT) patients (n = 7 per group; 86% male; 69.6 +/- 11.4, 67.9 +/- 8.6, and 70.2 +/- 7.9 years P > 0.9 for the CT, LC, and HD groups, respectively). Gene expression of members of the UPS, autophagy, and apoptotic systems was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. A global analysis of the soluble muscle proteome was conducted by shotgun proteomics for investigating the processes altered., RESULTS: We found an increased expression of several UPS and autophagy-related enzymes in both LC and HD patients. The E3 ligases MuRF1 (+56 to 78%, P < 0.01), MAFbx (+68 to 84%, P = 0.02), Hdm2 (+37 to 59%, P = 0.02), and MUSA1/Fbxo30 (+47 to 106%, P = 0.01) and the autophagy-related genes CTPL (+33 to 47%, P = 0.03) and SQSTM1 (+47 to 137%, P < 0.01) were overexpressed. Mass spectrometry identified >1700 proteins, and principal component analysis revealed three differential proteomes that matched to the three groups of patients. Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis created a model, which distinguished the muscles of diseased patients (LC or HD) from those of CT subjects. Proteins that most contributed to the model were selected. Functional analysis revealed up to 238 proteins belonging to nine metabolic processes (inflammatory response, proteolysis, cytoskeleton organization, glucose metabolism, muscle contraction, oxidant detoxification, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and extracellular matrix) involved in and/or altered by the atrophying programme in both LC and HD patients. This was confirmed by a co-expression network analysis., CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify highly similar modifications of several metabolic pathways in patients exhibiting diseases with different aetiologies (early-stage LC vs. long-term renal failure). This strongly suggests that a common atrophying programme exists independently of the disease in human. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a rare neurological syndrome of autoimmune origin. It is usually associated with small-cell lung cancer but may be idiopathic. The main clinical feature is potentially disabling limb muscle weakness. Clinical signs of autonomic nervous system involvement are frequent. The muscle weakness often improves with physical exercise, which distinguishes this syndrome from myasthenia. Tendon reflexes are reduced or absent but reappear temporarily after brief muscle contraction. Diagnosis is confirmed by electromyographic findings. Management is generally based on treatment of the underlying malignancy. Immunosuppressants are used in severe disease and in cases not associated with cancer, but they have limited efficacy. Symptomatic treatments are available but their efficacy is poorly documented.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer treatments are based on specific anticancer chemotherapy. However, there is increasing interest in general aspects of care, which are increasingly evidence based., STATE OF THE ART: The importance of muscle mass is becoming increasingly evident. Its role is not only limited to the maintenance of physical performance and quality of life. In oncology, recent studies have shown a close link between sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and mortality as well as between sarcopenia and chemotherapy toxicity. To treat malnutrition and the lack of energy intake, nutritional support is considered, whether through the prescription of oral nutritional supplements, enteral nutrition or even parenteral nutrition. Scientific arguments are often absent and few studies have been carried out in patients with lung cancer., PERSPECTIVES: There are many experimental arguments and a few clinical trials that support using omega 3 fatty acids to modulate inflammatory reaction and to reduce its consequences on muscular proteolysis. The benefit of regular physical activity has already been proven in chronic respiratory disease and its use in association with nutritional support must be recommended in oncologic care., CONCLUSION: Given the increasing recognition of the role of muscle mass in cancer, the purpose of any nutritional support must be focused on increasing muscle anabolism and decreasing proteolysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An international consensus proposed in 2011 a definition and classification system for cachexia (CAX), mainly based on weight loss, sarcopenia [skeletal muscle mass (SMM) loss], inflammation, and anorexia. The aim of this study was to stage CAX in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by using a classification based on the Fearon criteria and supported by quantifiable parameters., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional and non-interventional multicentre study. SMM was assessed by analysing L3 computed tomography-scan images. Patients completed the anorexia/CAX subscale of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy, EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life (QoL) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)., RESULTS: Patients were recruited in 56 sites. The analysis population comprised 531 patients, and SMM was assessed in 312 patients. Male patients were 66.5%, with a mean (SD) age of 65.2 (10.0) years, 79.9% were PS 0-1, and the tumour stage was mainly IIIB-IV (87.3%). Overall, 38.7% of patients had CAX, 33.8% pre-CAX, and 0.9% refractory CAX. Molecular tumour profiles were significantly associated with the presence of CAX: 23.9% in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, or HER2+ patients, 41.4% in K-RAS+, and 43.2% in patients with no molecular abnormality (P = 0.003). The more advanced the CAX stage, the poorer the scores of functional items of the QoL (P < 0.001) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (P < 0.001). Sarcopenia was present in 66.7% of CAX and 68.5% of pre-CAX patients. Overall, 43.8% of pre-CAX patients had only sarcopenia with limited weight loss (<=2%) and no anorexia., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show the distribution of CAX in a population of NSCLC patients and an association between molecular abnormality in NSCLC and CAX. The original Fearon classification for CAX stages was supported by the associated functional QoL scores and physical activity levels, resulting in a clinically relevant system for detection of early stages of CAX.

AB  - Malignant spinal cord compression(MSCC)is defined as a compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina with neuropathy caused by tumor spreading to the vertebral body. The common symptoms of MSCC are back pain, neck pain, muscle weakness, sensory reduction, bladder and rectal disturbance. The risk of MSCC is relatively high in patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. MSCC is one of the oncologic emergencies that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to preserve and improve neurological function. Evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)and computed tomography( CT)are useful for the diagnosis. The prognosis of these patients is often poor at the time of diagnosis of MSCC, thus it is important for deciding the treatment strategy to consider the prognosis and background of the patient in addition to the objective findings including the degree of MSCC and spinal instability. Treatment options consist of medical, surgical, and radiation therapy. We need a multidisciplinary approach because the pathology of MSCC involves multiple departments, such as medical oncology, orthopedics, and radiology. Supportive care including rehabilitation and preventing skeletal related events are also important. The cancer board, in which each physician and multidisciplinary health care professionals regularly have a discussion and review the cases, is required.

AB  - We report a 48-year-old female who presented limb-girdle type myasthenia gravis with inflammatory lung lesions and rheumatoid arthritis. She demonstrated a rapidly progressive muscle weakness of extremities. Neurological examination revealed facial muscle weakness, and proximal dominant limb muscle atrophy and weakness. Ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and bulbar palsy were not observed. The edrophonium test and serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody were positive. The repetitive nerve stimulation showed 55% waning in the thenar muscles. From these findings, she was diagnosed as having myasthenia gravis. Plain chest X-P and body CT showed tumor-like lesions in the lung. Lung biopsy revealed the infiltration of lymphocytes. These lesions decreased in size after thymectomy and corticosteroid administration. Immediately after thymectomy, she began to have morning stiffness with pain and swelling of the finger and knee joints. RAHA test, which was negative before thymectomy, became highly positive. These findings were consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. In this patient, thymus probably played a role to suppress the development of rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - An extremely rare case of acute inflammatory myopathy during combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a 57-year-old diabetic male patient is reported. Despite the early clinical partial response of the underlying malignancy to the chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient developed symmetrical, painful, proximal muscle weakness in the lower limbs with peripheral edema after the administration of the fourth cycle of treatment. The syndrome regressed definitely after the discontinuation of chemotherapy and the administration of corticosteroids. The diagnosis of drug-induced myositis is supported after the exclusion of other possible diagnoses.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated an effect of corticotropin-releasing factor 2 receptor (CRF2R) agonists in the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a CRF2R agonist in preserving skeletal muscle in a mouse cachexia model. Implantation of a fast-growing tumor to mice (Lewis lung carcinoma) resulted in a clear cachectic state characterized by a profound muscle wasting. We found that administration of a CRF2R agonist (PG-873637) at 100 microg/kg/day by means of osmotic minipumps to tumor-bearing mice resulted in beneficial effects on muscle weight loss. Thus, muscle loss was partially reversed by the CRF2R agonist at different stages of tumor growth (at day 14 after tumor inoculation: 12% in tibialis posterior; 9% in gastrocnemius; and 48% in soleus). Moreover, the CRF2R agonist significantly reduced both the number of metastases and their mass (at day 19 after tumor inoculation: 66% and 61%, respectively). These data suggest a potentially beneficial effect of the CRF2R agonist in preserving skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia and open a line of research for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of muscle wasting associated with cancer.

AB  - LEMS is a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder typically associated with small cell lung carcinoma. The characteristic electrophysiological abnormality is a low amplitude compound muscle action potential that shows a marked increment after short maximal contraction or brief tetanic nerve stimulation. Here we describe 3 patients who had LEMS in association with lymphoproliferative disorder. The first patient had Castleman's syndrome with typical clinical and electrophysiological features of LEMS, which responded partially to treatment with 3-4-diaminopyridine. The second patient was a 7-year-old boy who had an unusual acute onset of LEMS associated with relapse of his Burkitt's leukemia. The third patient was a 60-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These 3 patients (together with 6 additional patients identified in the literature) lead us to suggest that lymphoproliferative diseases are another, hitherto unrecognized, type of malignancy associated with LEMS. Thus, any patient with these malignancies and unexplained muscle weakness should have electrophysiological evaluation for LEMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated muscle wasting (CAW), a symptom of cancer cachexia, is associated with approximately 20% of lung cancer deaths and remains poorly characterized on a mechanistic level. Current animal models for lung cancer-associated cachexia are limited in that they (1) primarily employ flank transplantation methods, (2) have short survival times not reflective of the patient condition, and (3) are typically performed in young mice not representative of mean patient age. This study investigates a new model for lung cancer-associated cachexia that can address these issues and also implicates muscle regeneration as a contributor to CAW., METHODS: We used tail vein injection as a method to introduce tumor cells that seed primarily in the lungs of mice. Body composition of tumor-bearing mice was longitudinally tracked using NMR-based, echo magnetic resonance imaging (echoMRI). These data were combined with histological and molecular assessments of skeletal muscle to provide a complete analysis of muscle wasting., RESULTS: In this new lung CAW model, we observed (1) progressive loss in whole body weight, (2) progressive loss of lean and fat mass, (3) a circulating cytokine/inflammatory profile similar to that seen in other models of CAW, (4) histological changes associated with muscle wasting, and (5) molecular changes in muscle that implicate suppression of muscle repair/regeneration. Finally, we show that survival can be extended without lessening CAW by titrating injected cell number., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study describes a new model of CAW that could be useful for further studies of lung cancer-associated wasting and accompanying changes in the regenerative capacity of muscle. Additionally, this model addresses many recent concerns with existing models such as immunocompetence, tumor location, and survival time.

AB  - A 59-year-old man who was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), achieved a complete response to the induction chemoradiotherapy and received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (25 Gy at 250 cGy per fraction) in October 2008. Three months later, he complained of anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and short-term memory loss and developed dementia and systemic muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging in April and July 2009 revealed the progression of the diffuse brain atrophy without evidence of the metastasis of SCLC. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome was suspected because anti-Hu antibody was detected in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but the adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were also suspected as the cause of his neurological disorder.

AB  - PURPOSE: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with weight loss which may reflect skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and/or total adipose tissue (TAT) depletion. This study aimed to describe changes in body composition (BC) parameters and to identify the factors unrelated to the tumor which modulate them., METHODS: SMM, TAT, and the proportion of SMM to SMM + TAT were assessed with computed tomography. Estimates of each BC parameter at follow-up initiation and across time were derived from a mixed linear model of repeated measurements with a random intercept and a random slope. The same models were used to assess the independent effect of gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and initial values on changes in each BC parameter., RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with stage III or IV NSCLC were reviewed. The mean +/- SD decreases in body weight and SMM were respectively 59 +/- 3 g/week (P < 0.03) and 7 mm2/m2/week (P = 0.0003). During follow-up, no changes were identified in TAT nor in muscle density or in the proportion of SMM to SMM + TAT, estimated at 37 +/- 2% at baseline. SMM loss was influenced by initial BMI (P < 0.0001) and SMM values (P = 0.0002): the higher the initial BMI or SMM values, the greater the loss observed. Weight loss was greater when the initial weight was heavier (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that SMM wasting in NSCLC is lower when initial SMM and BMI values are low. These exploratory findings after our attempt to better understand the intrinsic factors associated with muscle mass depletion need to be confirmed in larger studies.

AB  - Cachexia, or wasting of skeletal muscle and fat, afflicts many patients with chronic diseases including cancer, organ failure, and AIDS. Muscle wasting reduces quality of life and decreases response to therapy. Cachexia is caused partly by elevated inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Others and we have shown that IL-6 alone is sufficient to induce cachexia both in vitro and in vivo. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor Selumetinib has been tested in clinical trials for various cancers. Moreover, Selumetinib has also been shown to inhibit the production of IL-6. In a retrospective analysis of a phase II clinical trial in advanced cholangiocarcinoma, patients treated with Selumetinib experienced significant gains in skeletal muscle vs. patients receiving standard therapy. However, the use of Selumetinib as a treatment for cachexia has yet to be investigated mechanistically. We sought to determine whether MEK inhibition could protect against cancer-induced cachexia in mice. In vitro, Selumetinib induced C2C12 myotube hypertrophy and nuclear accretion. Next we tested Selumetinib in the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model of cancer cachexia. Treatment with Selumetinib reduced tumor mass and reduced circulating and tumor IL-6; however MEK inhibition did not preserve muscle mass. Similar wasting was seen in limb muscles of Selumetinib and vehicle-treated LLC mice, while greater fat and carcass weight loss was observed with Selumetinib treatment. As well, Selumetinib did not block wasting in C2C12 myotubes treated with LLC serum. Taken together, out results suggest that this MEK inhibitor is not protective in LLC cancer cachexia despite lowering IL-6 levels, and further that it might exacerbate tumor-induced weight loss. Differences from other studies might be disease, species or model-specific.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of cancer patients experience dramatic weight loss, due to cachexia and consisting of skeletal muscle and fat tissue wasting. Cachexia is a negative prognostic factor, interferes with therapy and worsens the patients' quality of life by affecting muscle function. Mice bearing ectopically-implanted C26 colon carcinoma are widely used as an experimental model of cancer cachexia. As part of the search for novel clinical and basic research applications for this experimental model, we characterized novel cellular and molecular features of C26-bearing mice., METHODS: A fragment of C26 tumor was subcutaneously grafted in isogenic BALB/c mice. The mass growth and proliferation rate of the tumor were analyzed. Histological and cytofluorometric analyses were used to assess cell death, ploidy and differentiation of the tumor cells. The main features of skeletal muscle atrophy, which were highlighted by immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses, correlated with biochemical alterations. Muscle force and resistance to fatigue were measured and analyzed as major functional deficits of the cachectic musculature., RESULTS: We found that the C26 tumor, ectopically implanted in mice, is an undifferentiated carcinoma, which should be referred to as such and not as adenocarcinoma, a common misconception. The C26 tumor displays aneuploidy and histological features typical of transformed cells, incorporates BrdU and induces severe weight loss in the host, which is largely caused by muscle wasting. The latter appears to be due to proteasome-mediated protein degradation, which disrupts the sarcomeric structure and muscle fiber-extracellular matrix interactions. A pivotal functional deficit of cachectic muscle consists in increased fatigability, while the reported loss of tetanic force is not statistically significant following normalization for decreased muscle fiber size., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude, on the basis of the definition of cachexia, that ectopically-implanted C26 carcinoma represents a well standardized experimental model for research on cancer cachexia. We wish to point out that scientists using the C26 model to study cancer and those using the same model to study cachexia may be unaware of each other's works because they use different keywords; we present strategies to eliminate this gap and discuss the benefits of such an exchange of knowledge.

AB  - Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Affected patients frequently experience debilitating disease-related symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, fatigue, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain, despite the progresses achieved in term of treatment efficacy.Physical activity and exercise are nonpharmacological interventions that have been shown to improve fatigue, quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, muscle mass and strength, and psychological status in patients with lung cancer. Moreover, physical fitness levels, especially cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength, are demonstrated to be independent predictors of survival. Nevertheless, patients with lung cancer frequently present insufficient levels of physical activity and exercise, and these may contribute to quality of life impairment, reduction in functional capacity with skeletal muscle atrophy or weakness, and worsening of symptoms, particularly dyspnea. The molecular bases underlying the potential impact of exercise on the fitness and treatment outcome of patients with lung cancer are still elusive. Counteracting specific cancer cells' acquired capabilities (hallmarks of cancer), together with preventing treatment-induced adverse events, represent main candidate mechanisms.To date, the potential impact of physical activity and exercise in lung cancer remains to be fully appreciated, and no specific exercise guidelines for patients with lung cancer are available. In this article, we perform an in-depth review of the evidence supporting physical activity and exercise in lung cancer and suggest that integrating this kind of intervention within the framework of a global, multidimensional approach, taking into account also nutritional and psychological aspects, might be the most effective strategy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although growing evidence supports the safety and efficacy of exercise in lung cancer, both after surgery and during and after medical treatments, most patients are insufficiently active or sedentary. Engaging in exercise programs is particularly arduous for patients with lung cancer, mainly because of a series of physical and psychosocial disease-related barriers (including the smoking stigma). A continuous collaboration among oncologists and cancer exercise specialists is urgently needed in order to develop tailored programs based on patients' needs, preferences, and physical and psychological status. In this regard, benefit of exercise appears to be potentially enhanced when administered as a multidimensional, comprehensive approach to patients' well-being. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. We recently demonstrated that myostatin expression is upregulated in an experimental model of cancer cachexia, suggesting that modulations of this pathway might play a pathogenic role in cancer-related muscle wasting. The present study was designed to investigate whether myostatin signaling is modulated in the muscle of non-weight-losing (nWL) patients with lung and gastric cancer., METHODS: Myostatin signaling was studied in muscle biopsies obtained during surgical procedure from nWL patients affected by gastric (n=16) or lung (n=17) cancer. Western blotting was applied to test both the total expression of myostatin and the expression of phosphorylated form of GSK-3beta and Smad2/3., RESULTS: In patients with gastric cancer, the expression of both myostatin and phosphorylated GSK-3beta (p-GSK3beta) were significantly increased. By contrast, in patients with lung cancer, myostatin levels were comparable to controls, whereas the expression of p-GSK3beta significantly decreased in patients with disease stage III/IV., CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin signaling is altered in nWL cancer patients. Different tumor types may give rise to different patterns of molecular changes within the muscle, which occur even before cachexia becomes clinically apparent.

AB  - Paraneoplastic gastrointestinal syndromes rarely precede the actual detection of an overt cancer with gastroparesis being a very rare initial presentation. To increase the clinical awareness of this rare clinical entity, we present a case of severe gastroparesis that was later proven to be associated with an occult poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer. We then continue to briefly review the relevant literature on paraneoplastic gastrointestinal syndromes to date. A 61-year-old African-American man presented with two months history of severe post-prandial nausea, vomiting and bloating associated with unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds. General physical examination revealed cachexia, temporal muscle wasting and clubbing of nails in both hands. The following investigations were normal or negative: basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, chest X-ray and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed residual food in the stomach and scintigraphic gastric emptying studies were consistent with gastroparesis. CT scan of the chest was performed which revealed a spiculated nodule sized 9 mm in right upper lobe of the lung with right hilar lymphadenopathy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed hyper-metabolic activity in the right upper lobe nodule and right hilar adenopathy. Nodule resection and biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma. Due to the concern of paraneoplastic origin of his gastroparesis further serological testing showed positive anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies type 1 (Anti-Hu) and cytoplasmic purkinje cell antibodies (Anti-Yo). The patient was started on a chemotherapy combination of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel with a three-week course of local radiation therapy. Moreover, for the relief of his severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms dietary modifications, pro-kinetic agents and psychological counseling were used with gradual clinical improvement observed on follow-up visits.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the systemic effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in general and the musculoskeletal effects and cachexia in particular., RECENT FINDINGS: Shift in muscle fiber type from I to II, reduction of capillary/mitochondria ratio, reduction of oxidative enzymes and oxidative capacity, alteration in amino acid profile, changes in respiratory muscle dynamics, activation of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway with loss of contractile proteins are some of the factors found to cause muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chemotaxis and capability to produce more reactive oxygen species and to cause extracellular proteolysis are enhanced in neutrophils of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is shown to cause loss of myosin chains in a time and dose-dependent fashion and to induce production of reactive oxygen species through activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species fuel each other. Weight loss due to muscle wasting (cachexia) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not solely related to malnutrition and is an independent predictor of mortality. Causative factors for cachexia include cytokine effects, protein degradation enhanced by increased ubiquination, upregulation of mRNA for key enzymes, increased energy expenditure and neurohormonal effects such as leptin production and an imbalance in anabolic and catabolic hormone homeostasis., SUMMARY: The findings noted above may well have the common link of inflammation in and beyond the lungs.

AB  - Cancer cachexia has a significant negative effect on quality of life, survival and the response to treatment. Recent in vitro and experimental animal studies have shown that myosin may be the primary target of the muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia. In this study, we have extended these analyses to detailed studies of regulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis at the gene level, myofibrillar protein expression and regulation of muscle contraction at the muscle cell level in a 63-year old man with a newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer and a rapidly progressing lower extremity muscle wasting and paralysis. A significant preferential loss of the motor protein myosin together with a downregulation of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level was observed in the patient with cancer cachexia. This had a significant negative impact on muscle fiber size as well as maximum force normalized to muscle fiber cross-sectional area (specific tension).

AB  - The year 2001/2002 has been marked by a number of exciting new results for our understanding of anabolic and catabolic mediators and their participation in wasting states, as reflected by the contents of this section. It becomes ever more apparent that a clear understanding of how to shut off hypercatabolic and hypermetabolic processes is needed to underpin effective strategies for wasting syndromes. A particularly interesting development in the control of degradative processes in skeletal muscle is the discovery of several muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes, which confer specificity to the degradation of myofibrillar proteins and are situated in a pathway of proteolysis common to a variety of wasting states, may prove to be a valuable point of intervention in muscle atrophy. In the clinical arena, studies on non-small cell lung cancer patients as well as broader patient populations with solid tumours provide more evidence for a high incidence of hypermetabolism as well as low energy intake. The best therapies currently available for the cancer cachexia/anorexia syndrome have numerous limitations and tend mainly to attenuate losses rather than to promote a net gain of weight or lean body mass. Sustained hypermetabolism over the long course of disease progression constitutes an important contributor to negative energy balance, and its presence is likely to be a limiting factor to the success of current treatment approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prominent clinical feature of cachexia has traditionally been understood to be weight loss; however, in recognition of the potential for divergent behavior of muscle and adipose tissue, cachexia was recently defined as loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Detailed assessments are required to verify body composition in patients with cancer cachexia., DESIGN: We adopted a population-based approach to study body composition in patients with cancer, with the use of diagnostic computed tomography images acquired for cancer diagnosis and follow-up. A prospective cohort of 441 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who were referred consecutively to a regional medical oncology service in Alberta, Canada, was evaluated., RESULTS: At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI < 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8% and was present in patients in all BMI categories. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia., CONCLUSIONS: Wasting of skeletal muscle is a prominent feature of patients with lung cancer, despite normal or heavy body weights. The significance of muscle wasting in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients as a nutritional risk factor, as a prognostic factor, and as a predictor of cancer treatment toxicity is discussed in this article.

AB  - AIMS: Cachexia is a severe complication of cancer that adversely affects the course of the disease and is associated with high rates of mortality. Patients with cancer manifest symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and impaired exercise tolerance, which are clinical signs of chronic heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiac muscle wasting in cancer individuals., METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 177 individuals who died of cancer, including 58 lung, 60 pancreatic, and 59 gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and 42 cancer-free controls who died of other, non-cardiovascular reasons. Cancer cachexia (CC) was defined based on clinical and/or pathological diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) <20.0 kg/m2 and/or oedema-free body weight loss of 5.0% during the previous year or less. The pathology reports were analysed for BMI, heart weight (HW), and left and right ventricular wall thicknesses (LVWT and RVWT, respectively). The analysis of clinical data included recording of biochemical parameters and medication data of study patients. CC was detected in 54 (30.5%) subjects. Individuals with CC had a significantly lower HW than non-cachectic subjects (363.1 +/- 86.2 vs. 447.0 +/- 128.9 g, P < 0.001) and control group (412.9 +/- 75.8 g, P < 0.05). BMI correlated with HW in cases with GI cancer (r = 0.44, P < 0.001), lung cancer (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001), and pancreatic cancer (r = 0.39, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Body weight loss in individuals with lung, pancreatic, and GI cancers is accompanied by a decrease in HW. In patients with CC who receive cancer treatment, screening for cardiac muscle wasting may have clinical importance. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease involving more than airflow obstruction. Airflow obstruction has profound effects on cardiac function and gas exchange with systemic consequences. In addition, as COPD results from inflammation and/or alterations in repair mechanisms, the "spill-over" of inflammatory mediators into the circulation may result in important systemic manifestations of the disease, such as skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. Systemic inflammation may also initiate or worsen comorbid diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, osteoporosis, normocytic anaemia, lung cancer, depression and diabetes. Comorbid diseases potentiate the morbidity of COPD, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and healthcare costs. Comorbidities complicate the management of COPD and need to be evaluated carefully. Current therapies for comorbid diseases, such as statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-agonists, may provide unexpected benefits for COPD patients. Treatment of COPD inflammation may concomitantly treat systemic inflammation and associated comorbidities. However, new broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, have significant side-effects so it may be necessary to develop inhaled drugs in the future. Another approach is the reversal of corticosteroid resistance, for example with effective antioxidants. More research is needed on COPD comorbidities and their treatment.

AB  - Skeletal muscle, the most abundant tissue in mammals, is essential for any activity in life. Muscle dysfunction is a common systemic manifestation in highly prevalent conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer cachexia, and sepsis. It has a significant impact on exercise tolerance, thus worsening the patients' quality of life and survival. Among several factors, oxidative stress is a major player in the etiology of skeletal muscle dysfunction associated with those conditions. Whereas low levels of oxidants are absolutely required for normal cell adaptation, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) alter the function and structure of molecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids. Specifically, protein carbonylation, a common variety of protein oxidation, was shown to alter the function of key enzymes and structural proteins involved in muscle contractile performance. Moreover, increased levels of ROS may also activate proteolytic systems, thus leading to enhanced protein breakdown in several models. In the current review, the specific modifications induced by carbonylation in protein structure and function in muscles have been described. Furthermore, the potential role of ROS in the activation of proteolytic systems in skeletal muscles is also discussed. The review summarizes the effects of protein carbonylation on muscles in several models and conditions such as COPD, disuse muscle atrophy, cancer cachexia, sepsis, and aging. Future research should focus on the elucidation of the specific protein sites modified by ROS in these muscles using redox proteomics analyses and on the assessment of the consequent alterations in protein function and stability.

AB  - Muscle dysfunction, characterized by a reductive remodeling of muscle fibers, is a common systemic manifestation in highly prevalent conditions such as chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer cachexia, and critically ill patients. Skeletal muscle dysfunction and impaired muscle mass may predict morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic diseases, regardless of the underlying condition. High levels of oxidants may alter function and structure of key cellular molecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids, leading to cellular injury and death. Protein oxidation including protein carbonylation was demonstrated to modify enzyme activity and DNA binding of transcription factors, while also rendering proteins more prone to proteolytic degradation. Given the relevance of protein oxidation in the pathophysiology of many chronic conditions and their comorbidities, the current review focuses on the analysis of different studies in which the biological and clinical significance of the modifications induced by reactive carbonyls on proteins have been explored so far in skeletal muscles of patients and animal models of chronic conditions such as COPD, disuse muscle atrophy, cancer cachexia, sepsis, and physiological aging. Future research will elucidate the specific impact and sites of reactive carbonyls on muscle protein content and function in human conditions.

AB  - Respiratory muscle dysfunction is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic contractile activity induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in animals (animals and humans). We hypothesized that the respiratory muscle dysfunction associated with COPD may upregulate ER stress and UPR expression in diaphragm of stable patients with different degrees of airway obstruction and normal body composition. In diaphragm muscle specimens of patients with mild and moderate-to-severe COPD with preserved body composition and non-COPD controls (thoracotomy because of lung localized neoplasms), expression of protein misfolding (ER stress) and UPR markers, proteolysis and apoptosis (qRT-PCR and immunoblotting), and protein aggregates (lipofuscin, histology) were quantified. All patients and non-COPD controls were also clinically evaluated: lung and muscle functions and exercise capacity. Compared with non-COPD controls, patients exhibited mild and moderate-to-severe airflow limitation and diffusion capacity and impaired exercise tolerance and diaphragm strength. Moreover, compared with the controls, in the diaphragm of the COPD patients, slow-twitch fiber proportions increased, gene expression but not protein levels of protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 were upregulated, and no significant differences were found in markers of UPR transmembrane receptor pathways (activating transcription factor-6, inositol-requiring enzyme-1alpha, and protein kinase-like ER kinase), lipofuscin aggregates, proteolysis, or apoptosis. In stable COPD patients with a wide range of disease severity, reduced diaphragm force of contraction, and normal body composition, ER stress and UPR signaling were not induced in the main respiratory muscle. These findings imply that ER stress and UPR are probably not involved in the documented diaphragm muscle dysfunction (reduced strength) observed in all the study patients, even in those with severe airflow limitation. Hence, in stable COPD patients with normal body composition, therapeutic strategies targeted to treat diaphragm muscle dysfunction should not include UPR modulators, even in those with a more advanced disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with a wide range of disease severity, diaphragm muscle weakness, and normal body composition, endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling were not induced in the main respiratory muscle. These findings imply that endoplasmic reticulum stress and UPR are not involved in the documented diaphragm muscle dysfunction observed in the study patients, even in those with severe airflow limitation. In stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with normal body composition, therapeutic strategies should not include UPR modulators.

AB  - Impaired muscle strength and mass (sarcopenia) are common in patients with respiratory cachexia, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in lung cancer (LC)-cachexia. Misfolded/unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce the compensatory unfolded protein response (UPR). Expression of ER stress and UPR markers may be differentially upregulated in vastus lateralis (VL) of patients with respiratory sarcopenia associated with either a chronic condition (COPD) or subacute (LC)-cachexia. In VL specimens from 40 COPD patients (n = 21, sarcopenic, fat-free mass index [FFMI] 16 kg/m2 and n = 19, nonsarcopenic, FFMI 18 kg/m2 ), 13 patients with LC-cachexia (FFMI 17 kg/m2 ), and 19 healthy controls (FFMI 19 kg/m 2 ), expression markers of ER stress, UPR (protein kinase-like ER kinase [PERK], activating transcription factor [ATF] 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme [IRE] 1-alpha), oxidative stress, autophagy, proteolysis, and apoptosis (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting), and fiber atrophy (histology) were assessed. Atrophy and muscle wasting and weakness were seen in both groups of sarcopenic patients. Compared to healthy controls, in muscles of LC-cachexia patients, expression of ER stress markers and UPR (three arms) was significantly upregulated, while in sarcopenic COPD, expression of a few ER stress markers and IRE1-alpha arm was upregulated. ER stress and an exaggerated UPR were observed in the VL muscle of patients with respiratory sarcopenia. The three branches of UPR were similarly upregulated in muscles of cancer cachectic patients, whereas in sarcopenic COPD patients, only IRE1 was upregulated. The differential profile of muscle UPR in chronic and subacute respiratory conditions offers a niche for the design of specific novel therapeutic approaches. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer tumors present EGFR mutations associated with an increased response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Afatinib acts as an irreversible pan-ErbB-TKI. Areas covered: This review summarizes the results of clinical trials in NSCLC regarding its safety and efficacy. Expert opinion: Afatinib in 40 mg doses is highly effective in patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutations, improving progression-free survival and disease-related symptoms compared to chemotherapy. Additionally, afatinib has a better response rate and shows a small benefit in progression free survival compared to first-generation TKIs, and patients with exon 19 deletion could represent a subgroup with better prognosis and overall survival. Diarrhea, mucositis and rash are frequent adverse events induced by afatinib, these can impair quality of life and sometimes afatinib discontinuation is necessary. Management of adverse events, including early antidiarrheal treatment and prophylactic or early antibiotic management can reduce the gastrointestinal and cutaneous adverse events, respectively. Different risk factors, including malnourishment, sarcopenia, and low body surface might be associated with a higher toxicity risk, and these groups of patients could begin treatment with a low dose of afatinib followed by a close evaluation on tolerability and toxicity in order to slowly increase the dosage of afatinib.

AB  - Malignant tumors are known to have a "remote" or nonmetastatic effect on the central and peripheral nervous systems. Eight patients were seen with proximal muscle weakness in association with bronchogenic carcinoma (5), carcinoma of breast (2), and leukemia (1). Electromyography demonstrated small polyphasic motor unit potentials. Muscle biopsy, however, showed evidence of denervation. Electron microscopy revealed morphological abnormalities in the intramuscular segments of axons. This combination of EMG and biopsy findings is presented as evidence for a remote effect of tumor on the intramuscular distal axons.

AB  - The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized, as common feature, by inflammation of skeletal muscle and muscle weakness. Traditionally, IIMs have been subclassified in into polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis, but this subclassification has several limitations, because clinical features as well as treatment response vary within the three IIM subgroups. In the last years several novel autoantibodies in patients with IIMs have been identified. These autoantibodies can be myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) or myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAAs) and they may lead to a new approach to the classification of IIMs. This novel approach could help to subdivide patients in more homogeneous groups because, it is very rare that a patient has more than one MSAs positivity and each autoantibody is frequently associated with specific clinical features. Moreover, MSAs can help to identify subsets of IIMs also without muscular symptoms, like patients in which skin manifestations, arthritis or interstitial lung disease represent the main clinical feature. Additionally, as some autoantibodies may be associated to markedly severe manifestations, such as cancer or rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease, they can also provide a prognostic stratification of the patients.

AB  - Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) represent a heterogeneous group of autoimmune systemic diseases characterized by chronic muscle weakness and inflammatory cell infiltrates in skeletal muscle. The most frequent IIMs, such as adult-onset polymyositis and dermatomyositis, display a wide range of clinical manifestations other than myositis, including skin changes, Raynaud's phenomenon and interstitial lung disease. Cardiac involvement is now well recognized as a clinically important manifestation in patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, although its actual frequency is still uncertain. Cardiovascular complications represent one of the most frequent causes of death in myositis, apart from cancer and lung involvement. Despite the fact that clinical manifestations are relatively rare, asymptomatic cardiovascular features are frequently reported in patients with polydermatomyositis and dermatomyositis. They are characterized by isolated electrocardiographic changes, valve disease, coronary vasculitis, ischemic abnormalities, heart failure and myocarditis. Chronic inflammation producing myocyte degeneration, tissues fibrosis and vascular alterations can explain the majority of reported cardiac features in myositic patients. Although previous works reported an association between heart involvement and some myositis-specific autoantibodies (namely anti-signal recognition particle), electrocardiography, echocardiography and, where necessary, heart magnetic resonance remain the mainstay for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial inflammation in these diseases. Anyway, a complete multiorgan assessment and a careful analysis of autoantibodies should be performed in every patient in order to define any possible distinct disease entities with different prognosis within the spectrum of IIMs.

AB  - The ubiquitin system plays a critical role in muscle wasting. Previous work has focused on the roles of ubiquitination. However, a role for deubiquitination in this process has not been established. Because ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)19 deubiquitinating enzyme is induced in skeletal muscle in many catabolic conditions, we generated USP19 knockout (KO) mice. These mice lost less muscle mass than wild-type (WT) animals in response to glucocorticoids, a common systemic cause of muscle atrophy as well as in response to denervation, a model of disuse atrophy. KO mice retained more strength and had less myofiber atrophy with both type I and type IIb fibers being protected. Rates of muscle protein synthesis were similar in WT and KO mice, suggesting that the sparing of atrophy was attributed to suppressed protein degradation. Consistent with this, expression of the ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 as well as several autophagy genes was decreased in the muscles of catabolic KO mice. Expression of USP19 correlates with that of MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 in skeletal muscles from patients with lung cancer or gastrointestinal cancer, suggesting that USP19 is involved in human muscle wasting. Inhibition of USP19 may be a useful approach to the treatment of many muscle-wasting conditions. Copyright © FASEB.

AB  - Voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies are generally associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. However the presence of this antibody has been associated with paraneoplastic as well as non-paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Most patients with VGCC-antibody-positivity have small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of the presynaptic part of the neuromuscular junction. Its classical clinical triad is proximal muscle weakness, areflexia and autonomic dysfunction. Fifty to sixty percent of LEMS patients have a neoplasia, usually SCLC. The co-occurrence of SCLC and LEMS causes more severe and progressive disease and shorter survival than non-paraneoplastic LEMS. Treatment includes 3,4 diaminopyridine for symptomatic purposes and immunotherapy with prednisolone, azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin in patients unresponsive to 3,4 diaminopyridine. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a syndrome characterized with severe, subacute pancerebellar dysfunction. Serum is positive for VGCC antibody in 41%-44% of patients, usually with the co-occurrence of SCLC. Clinical and electrophysiological features of LEMS are also present in 20%-40% of these patients. Unfortunately, PCD symptoms do not improve with immunotherapy. The role of VGCC antibody in the immunopathogenesis of LEMS is well known whereas its role in PCD is still unclear. All patients presenting with LEMS or PCD must be investigated for SCLC.

AB  - Reductive stress is defined as a condition of sustained increase in cellular glutathione/glutathione disulfide and NADH/NAD+ ratios. Reductive stress is emerging as an important pathophysiological event in several diseased states, being as detrimental as is oxidative stress. Occurrence of reductive stress has been documented in several cardiomyopathies and is an important pathophysiological factor particularly in coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Excess activation of the transcription factor, Nrf2-the master regulator of the antioxidant response-, consequent in most cases to defective autophagy, can lead to reductive stress. In addition, hyperglycemia-induced activation of the polyol pathway can lead to increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, which might translate into increased levels of hydrogen sulfide-via enhanced activity of cystathionine beta-synthase-that would fuel reductive stress through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. Reductive stress may be either a potential weapon against cancer priming tumor cells to apoptosis or a cancer's ally promoting tumor cell proliferation and making tumor cells resistant to reactive oxygen species-inducing drugs. In non-cancer pathological states reductive stress is definitely harmful paradoxically leading to reactive oxygen species overproduction via excess NADPH oxidase 4 activity. In face of the documented occurrence of reductive stress in several heart diseases, there is much less information about the occurrence and effects of reductive stress in skeletal muscle tissue. In the present review we describe relevant results emerged from studies of reductive stress in the heart and review skeletal muscle conditions in which reductive stress has been experimentally documented and those in which reductive stress might have an as yet unrecognized pathophysiological role. Establishing whether reductive stress has a (patho)physiological role in skeletal muscle will hopefully contribute to answer the question whether antioxidant supplementation to the general population, athletes, and a large cohort of patients (e.g. heart, sarcopenic, dystrophic, myopathic, cancer, and bronco-pulmonary patients) is harmless or detrimental.

AB  - We present the case of multiple sclerosing pneumocytomas (SPs) associated with ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumorlets responsible for an ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS). SP is a rare benign tumor originating from pulmonary epithelial cells. An 18-year-old male presented with shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain after exercise. Chest radiograph indicated right pneumothorax and bilateral lung nodules. CT imaging showed innumerable bilateral hypodense pulmonary nodules and a wedge resection gave the definitive diagnosis of SP with associated carcinoid tumorlets. Two years later, he presented with severe back pain in context of thoracic vertebral compression fracture. He had central fat accumulation, violaceous striae, proximal muscle weakness, hypertension, and diabetes. MRI of the pituitary gland showed a 7-mm adenoma. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling with no central-to-periphery gradient suggested an ectopic origin of ACTH, which was confirmed by ACTH expression in a subset of tumorlet cells in the lung lesions. The patient was started on ketoconazole and subsequently underwent a bilateral adrenalectomy. During follow-up, CT scans showed no growth of the lesions, except for the most recent CT scan, in which an increase in the size of the largest nodule was described. Ten years after the diagnosis, the patient remains asymptomatic of his pulmonary lesions. This article provides a case of ECS in the setting of multiple SP with associated carcinoid tumorlets.

AB  - We present the case of multiple sclerosing pneumocytomas (SPs) associated with ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumorlets responsible for an ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS). SP is a rare benign tumor originating from pulmonary epithelial cells. An 18-year-old male presented with shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain after exercise. Chest radiograph indicated right pneumothorax and bilateral lung nodules. CT imaging showed innumerable bilateral hypodense pulmonary nodules and a wedge resection gave the definitive diagnosis of SP with associated carcinoid tumorlets. Two years later, he presented with severe back pain in context of thoracic vertebral compression fracture. He had central fat accumulation, violaceous striae, proximal muscle weakness, hypertension, and diabetes. MRI of the pituitary gland showed a 7-mm adenoma. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling with no central-to-periphery gradient suggested an ectopic origin of ACTH, which was confirmed by ACTH expression in a subset of tumorlet cells in the lung lesions. The patient was started on ketoconazole and subsequently underwent a bilateral adrenalectomy. During follow-up, CT scans showed no growth of the lesions, except for the most recent CT scan, in which an increase in the size of the largest nodule was described. Ten years after the diagnosis, the patient remains asymptomatic of his pulmonary lesions. This article provides a case of ECS in the setting of multiple SP with associated carcinoid tumorlets.

AB  - Cachexia, progressive loss of fat and muscle mass despite adequate nutrition, is a devastating complication of cancer associated with poor quality of life and increased mortality. Myostatin is a potent tonic muscle growth inhibitor. We tested how myostatin inhibition might influence cancer cachexia using genetic and pharmacological approaches. First, hypermuscular myostatin null mice were injected with Lewis lung carcinoma or B16F10 melanoma cells. Myostatin null mice were more sensitive to tumor-induced cachexia, losing more absolute mass and proportionately more muscle mass than wild-type mice. Because myostatin null mice lack expression from development, however, we also sought to manipulate myostatin acutely. The histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A has been shown to increase muscle mass in normal and dystrophic mice by inducing the myostatin inhibitor, follistatin. Although Trichostatin A administration induced muscle growth in normal mice, it failed to preserve muscle in colon-26 cancer cachexia. Finally we sought to inhibit myostatin and related ligands by administration of the Activin receptor extracellular domain/Fc fusion protein, ACVR2B-Fc. Systemic administration of ACVR2B-Fc potently inhibited muscle wasting and protected adipose stores in both colon-26 and Lewis lung carcinoma cachexia, without affecting tumor growth. Enhanced cachexia in myostatin knockouts indicates that host-derived myostatin is not the sole mediator of muscle wasting in cancer. More importantly, skeletal muscle preservation with ACVR2B-Fc establishes that targeting myostatin-family ligands using ACVR2B-Fc or related molecules is an important and potent therapeutic avenue in cancer cachexia.

AB  - To evaluate the neurotoxicity of paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy, we studied neurological and electrophysiological functions in 14 patients who had been treated with 1-7 courses of paclitaxel/cisplatin. The cumulative paclitaxel and cisplatin doses ranged from 175 to 1225 mg/m2 and 100-700 mg/m2, respectively. Neurological examinations as well as motor nerve conduction studies of the peroneal nerve were performed and summarised by means of a peripheral neuropathy score. Neurotoxicity with onset usually after the second treatment cycle occurred in 13 patients. 12 patients complained about sensory symptoms, 13 patients had impaired vibration sense and 8 patients developed additional muscle weakness, predominantly of the legs. Dysfunction of peroneal motor nerve conduction occurred in 13 patients. Reduction of amplitudes as well as slowing of conduction velocities were seen in 13 patients and prolonged distal latencies in 10 patients. The peripheral neuropathy score was elevated in 13 patients. Neurological symptoms, impairment of both vibration sense and tendon reflexes, and the peripheral neuropathy score increased with the cumulative doses of paclitaxel/cisplatin. Serial analysis among selected patients also revealed an increase in neurotoxicity with increasing cumulative drug doses. These data indicate the development of neurotoxicity in most patients treated with paclitaxel/cisplatin and also suggest that early signs of neurotoxicity can be detected by clinical examination with emphasis on symptoms as well as vibration sense and can be well documented by electrophysiological investigations.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an incurable global health burden and is characterised by progressive airflow limitation and loss of lung function. In addition to the pulmonary impact of the disease, COPD patients often develop comorbid diseases such as cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle wasting, lung cancer and osteoporosis. One key feature of COPD, yet often underappreciated, is the contribution of oxidative stress in the onset and development of the disease. Patients experience an increased burden of oxidative stress due to the combined effects of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) generation, antioxidant depletion and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity. Currently, there is a lack of effective treatments for COPD, and an even greater lack of research regarding interventions that treat both COPD and its comorbidities. Due to the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of COPD and many of its comorbidities, a unique therapeutic opportunity arises where the treatment of a multitude of diseases may be possible with only one therapeutic target. In this review, oxidative stress and the roles of ROS/RNS in the context of COPD and comorbid cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle wasting, lung cancer, and osteoporosis are discussed and the potential for therapeutic benefit of anti-oxidative treatment in these conditions is outlined. Because of the unique interplay between oxidative stress and these diseases, oxidative stress represents a novel target for the treatment of COPD and its comorbidities. Copyright © 2015.

AB  - Background: None of the published studies involving cancer cachexia experimental models have included a measure of the severity of the syndrome like the scoring system previously developed for human subjects. The aim of the present investigation was to define and validate a cachexia score usable in both rat and mouse tumor models., Methods: In order to achieve this goal, we included in the study one rat model (Yoshida AH-130ascites hepatoma) and two mouse models (Lewis lung carcinoma and Colon26 carcinoma). The Animal cachexia score (ACASCO) includes five components: (a) body and muscle weight loss, (b) inflammation and metabolic disturbances, (c) physical performance, (d) anorexia, and (e) quality of life measured using discomfort symptoms and behavioral tests., Results: Using the ACASCO values, three cut-off values were estimated by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Four groups were originally described, one exactly below the observed mean, a second exactly over the mean, and two other groups adjusted to every cue (inferior and superior). The three cut-off values were estimated through maximization of the classification function. This was accomplished by using a similarity matrix based on the metric properties of the variables and assuming multinormal distribution. The results show that the four groups were: no cachexia, mild cachexia, moderate cachexia and advanced cachexia., Conclusions: The results obtained allow us to conclude that the score could be very useful as an endpoint in pre-clinical studies involving therapeutic strategies for cancer cachexia. The potential usefulness of ACASCO relates to the primary endpoint in pre-clinical cancer cachexia drug evaluations. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Osteoporosis and fragility fracture become common with advancing age in men. The incidence of osteoporosis-related fracture is similar to myocardial infarction and exceeds that of lung and prostate carcinoma combined. These fractures cause substantial morbidity, and the mortality following hip fracture is greater in men than in women. A decline in sex steroids and glucocorticoid and alcohol use, among other factors, contribute to bone loss and fracture risk. Approaches to reduce fracture risk in men are very similar to that in women - recognising and addressing muscle weakness/falls risk and optimising nutrition, with emphasis on calcium and vitamin D and medications when appropriate. Despite the high prevalence, osteoporosis remains largely undiagnosed and undertreated. Hopefully, increased recognition of male osteoporosis by health-care providers and the men themselves, in combination with recent consensus recommendations for treatment based on fracture-risk estimation, will reduce the burden of fragility fracture in men.

AB  - Cancer-cachexia (CC) is a wasting condition directly responsible for 20-40% of cancer-related deaths. The mechanisms controlling development of CC-induced muscle wasting are not fully elucidated. Most investigations focus on the postcachectic state and do not examine progression of the condition. We recently demonstrated mitochondrial degenerations precede muscle wasting in time course progression of CC. However, the extent of muscle perturbations before wasting in CC is unknown. Therefore, we performed global gene expression analysis in CC-induced muscle wasting to enhance understanding of intramuscular perturbations across the development of CC. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) was injected into the hind-flank of C57BL6/J mice at 8 wk of age with tumor allowed to develop for 1, 2, 3, or 4 wk and compared with PBS-injected control. Muscle wasting was evident at 4 wk LLC. RNA sequencing of gastrocnemius muscle samples showed widespread alterations in LLC compared with PBS animals with largest differences seen in 4 wk LLC, suggesting extensive transcriptomic alterations concurrent to muscle wasting. Commonly altered pathways included: mitochondrial dysfunction and protein ubiquitination, along with other less studied processes in this condition regulating transcription/translation and cytoskeletal structure. Current findings present novel evidence of transcriptomic shifts and altered cellular pathways in CC-induced muscle wasting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive loss of muscle mass is a major characteristic of cancer cachexia. Consensus definitions for cachexia provide different options to measure muscle mass. This study describes the effect of different methods to determine muscle mass on the diagnosis of cancer cachexia. In addition, the association of cachexia with other features of cachexia, quality of life, and survival was explored., METHODS: Prior to chemotherapy, cachexia was assessed by weight loss, body mass index, and muscle mass measurements, the latter by mid-upper arm muscle area (MUAMA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). In addition, appetite, inflammation, muscle strength, fatigue, quality of life, and survival were measured, and associations with cachexia were explored., RESULTS: Included were 241 patients with advanced cancer of the lung (36%), colon/rectum (31%), prostate (18%), or breast (15%). Mean age was 64 +/- 10 years; 54% was male. Prevalence of low muscle mass was as follows: 13% with MUAMA, 59% with CT, and 93% with BIA. In turn, the prevalence of cachexia was 37, 43, and 48%, whereby weight loss >5% was the most prominent component of being defined cachectic. Irrespective of type of muscle measurement, patients with cachexia presented more often with anorexia, inflammation, low muscle strength, and fatigue and had lower quality of life. Patients with cachexia had worse overall survival compared with patients without cachexia: HRs 2.00 (1.42-2.83) with MUAMA, 1.64 (1.15-2.34) with CT, and 1.50 (1.05-2.14) with BIA., CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of low muscle mass in patients with cancer depended largely on the type of muscle measurement, this had little influence on the diagnosis of cancer cachexia (as the majority of patients was already defined cachectic based on weight loss). New studies are warranted to further elucidate the additional role of muscle measurements in the diagnosis of cachexia and the association with clinical outcomes. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Cachexia is a devastating syndrome that causes morbidity and mortality in a large number of patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms of cancer cachexia remain poorly understood. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress. The ER responds to this stress through activating certain pathways commonly known as the unfolding protein response (UPR). The main function of UPR is to restore homeostasis, but excessive or prolonged activation of UPR can lead to pathologic conditions. In this study, we examined the role of ER stress and UPR in regulation of skeletal muscle mass in naive conditions and during cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that multiple markers of ER stress are highly activated in skeletal muscle of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and Apc(Min/+) mouse models of cancer cachexia. Treatment of mice with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperon and a potent inhibitor of ER stress, significantly reduced skeletal muscle strength and mass in both control and LLC-bearing mice. Blocking the UPR also increased the proportion of fast-type fibers in soleus muscle of both control and LLC-bearing mice. Inhibition of UPR reduced the activity of Akt/mTOR pathway and increased the expression of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in LLC-bearing mice. Moreover, we found that the inhibition of UPR causes severe atrophy in cultured myotubes. Our study provides initial evidence that ER stress and UPR pathways are essential for maintaining skeletal muscle mass and strength and for protection against cancer cachexia.-Bohnert, K.

AB  - Skeletal muscle wasting causes both morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that the markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways are increased in skeletal muscle under multiple catabolic conditions, including cancer. However, the signaling mechanisms and the role of individual arms of the UPR in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass remain largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that gene expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) was increased in skeletal muscle in a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model of cancer cachexia. Targeted ablation of MyD88 inhibits the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in LLC tumor-bearing mice. Inhibition of MyD88 attenuates the LLC-induced activation of the UPR in skeletal muscle of mice. Moreover, muscle-specific deletion of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), a major downstream target of IRE1alpha arm of the UPR, ameliorates muscle wasting in LLC tumor-bearing mice. Our results also demonstrate that overexpression of an active form of XBP1 caused atrophy in cultured myotubes. In contrast, knockdown of XBP1 inhibits myotube atrophy in response to LLC or C26 adenocarcinoma cell conditioned medium. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TLR/MyD88-mediated activation of XBP1 causes skeletal muscle wasting in LLC tumor-bearing mice. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Antisynthetase syndrome is a heterogeneous idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Anti-Jo1 is the most common antibody found in this condition. Dermatomyositis is known to be associated with malignancy, but the association between antisynthetase syndrome and malignancy is not clearly established. We report a case of an association of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and anti-Jo1 antisynthetase syndrome. A 67-year-old man presented with polyarthritis, muscle weakness of the pelvic girdle, "mechanic's hands," and weight loss. A diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome was considered based on the clinical features and the presence of anti-Jo1 antibodies. Positron emission tomography was performed because of weight loss and revealed a pulmonary hypermetabolic lesion. Histological findings revealed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent lobectomy and is currently free of symptoms with regular monitoring. This unusual presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung illustrates the need of a systematic approach to the diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome. Positron emission tomography can be a useful imaging modality in the diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with antisynthetase syndrome especially in the presence of warning signs/symptoms.

AB  - Pancoast's syndrome is characterized by pain in the shoulders and upper extremities, Horner's syndrome, bone loss and hand muscle atrophy. Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common cause, although other neoplasms or lung infection are occasionally responsible. An apical mass on the chest film can be seen in over 90% of cases, although apical pleural thickening is sometimes the only radiographic finding. We describe a patient whose clinical picture was highly suggestive of Pancoast's syndrome but whose chest film was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a cervical mass adjacent to the brachial plexus that proved to be cervical metastasis from an unknown primary tumor. We emphasize the need to consider the possibility of a metastatic cervical tumor compromising the brachial plexus in patients with a normal chest X-ray but clinical signs highly suggestive of Pancoast's syndrome.

AB  - The development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been associated with increased oxidative stress or reduced antioxidant resources. Several indicators of oxidative stress, such as hydrogen peroxide exhalation, lipid peroxidation products and degraded proteins, are indeed elevated in COPD patients. As a result, the antioxidant capacity decreases in COPD patients. The fall in antioxidant capacity of blood from COPD patients should not only be regarded as a reflection of the occurrence of oxidative stress but also as evidence that oxidative stress spreads out to the circulation and can therefore generate a systemic effect. COPD is linked to weight loss and in particular to loss in fat-free mass by skeletal muscle wasting. This systemic effect can be mediated by both oxidative stress and oxidative stress-mediated processes like apoptosis and inflammation. Furthermore, COPD is a predisposition for lung cancer through several mechanisms including oxidative stress and oxidative stress-mediated processes such as inflammation and disruption of genomic integrity. Current therapeutic interventions against the far-reaching consequences of the systemic oxidative stress in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are not yet optimised. A diet designed to reduce chronic metabolic stress might form an effective therapeutic strategy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - Three new cases of myelopathy without compression associated with paraproteinemia are reported. The neurologic picture was that of spinal muscular atrophy in one case and chronic spinal combined sclerosis in two. The nature of the paraproteinemia is discussed: all three patients seem to have had benign monoclonal dysglobulinemia. One patient died from cardiovascular disease five years after onset, and another from complications related to decubitus seven years after onset. Postmortem examination was not possible in either case. Spinal muscular atrophy has been reported in certain carcinomas (lung, stomach, breast) and, less frequently, in macroglobulinemia. As benign dysglobulinemia is common after sixty, coincidental association cannot be outruled. However, data from the literature and the response to cancer chemotherapy in two patients suggest an original pathologic association. Recent demonstration of demyelinating neuropathies associated with benign paraproteinemia provide further evidence in support of such an association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myostatin is a muscle derived factor that functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Induction of myostatin expression was observed in rodent models of muscle wasting and in cachectic patients with cancer or pulmonary disease. Therefore, there is an increasing interest to use serum myostatin as a biomarker., METHODS: We established an immunoradiometric sandwich assay (IRMA), which uses a commercially available chicken polyclonal, affinity purified antibody directed against human myostatin prodomain. We determined the serum concentrations of myostatin prodomain in 249 healthy individuals as well as 169 patients with heart failure, 53 patients with cancer and 44 patients with chronic pulmonary disease., RESULTS: The IRMA had a detection limit of 0.7ng/ml, an intraassay imprecision of <=14.1% and an interassay imprecision of <= 18.9%. The specificity of our assay was demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography, detection of myostatin by Western-blotting and a SMAD-dependent transcriptional-reporter assay in the signal-rich serum fractions, as well as lack of interference by unspecific substances like albumin, hemoglobin or lipids. Myostatin prodomain was stable at room temperature and resistant to freeze-thaw cycles. Apparently healthy individuals over the age of 55 had a median myostatin prodomain serum concentration of 3.9ng/ml (25(th)-75(th) percentiles, 2-7ng/ml) and we could not detect increased levels in patients with stable chronic heart failure or cancer related weight loss. In contrast, we found strongly elevated concentrations of myostatin prodomain (median 26.9ng/ml, 25(th)-75(th) percentiles, 7-100ng/ml) in the serum of underweight patients with chronic pulmonary disease., CONCLUSIONS: We established a highly specific IRMA for the quantification of myostatin prodomain concentration in human serum. Our assay could be useful to study myostatin as a biomarker for example in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, as we detected highly elevated myostatin prodomain serum levels in underweight individuals of this group.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder mediated by autoantibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels. The disorder is diagnosed clinically on the basis of a triad of symptoms (proximal muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic disturbance), supported by electrophysiological findings and the presence of autoantibodies. Between 40% and 62% of patients diagnosed with LEMS are found to have small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), almost all of whom develop neurological symptoms before their cancer is diagnosed. Prompt identification of LEMS and appropriate screening for SCLC is key to improving the outcome of both conditions. Here we review the pathophysiology and clinical management of LEMS, focusing particularly on the relationship with SCLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although polymyositis and dermatomyositis are regarded as treatable disorders, prognosis is not well known, as in the literature long-term outcome and prognostic factors vary widely., AIM: To analyse the prognostic outcome factors in polymyositis and adult dermatomyositis., METHODS: We determined mortality, clinical outcome (muscle strength, disability, persistent use of drugs and quality of life) and disease course and analysed prognostic outcome factors., RESULTS: Disease-related death occurred in at least 10% of the patients, mainly because of associated cancer and pulmonary complications. Re-examination of 110 patients after a median follow-up of 5 years showed that 20% remained in remission and were off drugs, whereas 80% had a polycyclic or chronic continuous course. The cumulative risk of incident connective tissue disorder in patients with myositis was significantly increased. 65% of the patients had normal strength at follow-up, 34% had no or slight disability, and 16% had normal physical sickness impact profile scores. Muscle weakness was associated with higher age (odds ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 10.3). Disability was associated with male sex (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 7.9). 41% of the patients with a favourable clinical outcome were still using drugs. Jo-1 antibodies predicted the persistent use of drugs (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 15.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are serious diseases with a disease-related mortality of at least 10%. In the long term, myositis has a major effect on perceived disability and quality of life, despite the regained muscle strength.

AB  - This review examines the relationship between physical activity and cancer along the cancer continuum, and serves as a synthesis of systematic and meta-analytic reviews conducted to date. There exists a large body of epidemiologic evidence that conclude those who participate in higher levels of physical activity have a reduced likelihood of developing a variety of cancers compared to those who engage in lower levels of physical activity. Despite this observational evidence, the causal pathway underlying the association between participation in physical activity and cancer risk reduction remains unclear. Physical activity is also a useful adjunct to improve the deleterious sequelae experienced during cancer treatment. These deleterious sequelae may include fatigue, muscular weakness, deteriorated functional capacity, and many others. The benefits of physical activity during cancer treatment are similar to those experienced after treatment. Despite the growing volume of literature examining physical activity and cancer across the cancer continuum, a number of research gaps exist. There is little evidence on the safety of physical activity among all cancer survivors, as most trials have selectively recruited participants. The specific dose of exercise needed to optimize primary cancer prevention or symptom control during and after cancer treatment remains to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia occurs in approximately 80% of cancer patients and is a key contributor to cancer-related death. The mechanisms controlling development of tumour-induced muscle wasting are not fully elucidated. Specifically, the progression and development of cancer cachexia are underexplored. Therefore, we examined skeletal muscle protein turnover throughout the development of cancer cachexia in tumour-bearing mice., METHODS: Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) was injected into the hind flank of C57BL6/J mice at 8 weeks age with tumour allowed to develop for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks and compared with PBS injected control. Muscle size was measured by cross-sectional area analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained tibialis anterior muscle. 2 H2 O was used to assess protein synthesis throughout the development of cancer cachexia. Immunoblot and RT-qPCR were used to measure regulators of protein turnover. TUNEL staining was utilized to measure apoptotic nuclei. LLC conditioned media (LCM) treatment of C2C12 myotubes was used to analyse cancer cachexia in vitro., RESULTS: Muscle cross-sectional area decreased ~40% 4 weeks following tumour implantation. Myogenic signalling was suppressed in tumour-bearing mice as soon as 1 week following tumour implantation, including lower mRNA contents of Pax7, MyoD, CyclinD1, and Myogenin, when compared with control animals. AchRdelta and AchRepsilon mRNA contents were down-regulated by ~50% 3 weeks following tumour implantation. Mixed fractional synthesis rate protein synthesis was ~40% lower in 4 week tumour-bearing mice when compared with PBS controls. Protein ubiquitination was elevated by ~50% 4 weeks after tumour implantation. Moreover, there was an increase in autophagy machinery after 4 weeks of tumour growth. Finally, ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylations were fourfold and threefold greater than control muscle 4 weeks following tumour implantation, respectively. Inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not ERK MAPK, in vitro partially rescued LCM-induced loss of myotube diameter., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings work towards understanding the pathophysiological signalling in skeletal muscle in the initial development of cancer cachexia. Shortly following the onset of the tumour-bearing state alterations in myogenic regulatory factors are apparent, suggesting early onset alterations in the capacity for myogenic induction. Cancer cachexia presents with a combination of a loss of protein synthesis and increased markers of protein breakdown, specifically in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Also, p38 MAPK may be a potential therapeutic target to combat cancer cachexia via a p38-FOX01-atrogene-ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is largely irreversible, at least via nutritional means, and responsible for 20-40% of cancer-related deaths. Therefore, preventive measures are of primary importance; however, little is known about muscle perturbations prior to onset of cachexia. Cancer cachexia is associated with mitochondrial degeneration; yet, it remains to be determined if mitochondrial degeneration precedes muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. Therefore, our purpose was to determine if mitochondrial degeneration precedes cancer-induced muscle wasting in tumour-bearing mice., METHODS: First, weight-stable (MinStable) and cachectic (MinCC) ApcMin/+ mice were compared with C57Bl6/J controls for mRNA contents of mitochondrial quality regulators in quadriceps muscle. Next, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells or PBS (control) were injected into the hind flank of C57Bl6/J mice at 8 week age, and tumour allowed to develop for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks to examine time course of cachectic development. Succinate dehydrogenase stain was used to measure oxidative phenotype in tibialis anterior muscle. Mitochondrial quality and function were assessed using the reporter MitoTimer by transfection to flexor digitorum brevis and mitochondrial function/ROS emission in permeabilized adult myofibres from plantaris. RT-qPCR and immunoblot measured the expression of mitochondrial quality control and antioxidant proteins. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Kuels post hoc test., RESULTS: MinStable mice displayed ~50% lower Pgc-1alpha, Pparalpha, and Mfn2 compared with C57Bl6/J controls, whereas MinCC exhibited 10-fold greater Bnip3 content compared with C57Bl6/J controls. In LLC, cachectic muscle loss was evident only at 4 weeks post-tumour implantation. Oxidative capacity and mitochondrial content decreased by ~40% 4 weeks post-tumour implantation. Mitochondrial function decreased by ~25% by 3 weeks after tumour implantation. Mitochondrial degeneration was evident by 2 week LLC compared with PBS control, indicated by MitoTimer red/green ratio and number of pure red puncta. Mitochondrial ROS production was elevated by ~50 to ~100% when compared with PBS at 1-3 weeks post-tumour implantation. Mitochondrial quality control was dysregulated throughout the progression of cancer cachexia in tumour-bearing mice. In contrast, antioxidant proteins were not altered in cachectic muscle wasting., CONCLUSIONS: Functional mitochondrial degeneration is evident in LLC tumour-bearing mice prior to muscle atrophy. Contents of mitochondrial quality regulators across ApcMin/+ and LLC mice suggest impaired mitochondrial quality control as a commonality among pre-clinical models of cancer cachexia. Our data provide novel evidence for impaired mitochondrial health prior to cachectic muscle loss and provide a potential therapeutic target to prevent cancer cachexia. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The clinical features and necropsy findings are described in three cases in which severe and rapidly progressive muscle weakness developed in association with carcinoma of the bronchus. In all three cases, muscular weakness was directly responsible for death. Histological and ultramicroscopical examination in all cases showed an unusual type of degeneration of muscle fibres accompanied by degeneration of intramuscular nerve fibres, but without involvement of the central nervous system, or of the peripheral nerve trunks. The findings are compared with those of previously reported cases, and possible mechanisms for the muscle degeneration are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Sarcopenia describes the loss of skeletal muscle mass. While this condition is associated with a high mortality in cancer patients, its influence on survival is still underestimated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review for articles was performed using the PubMed database, Cochrane Library, Biomed Central, Science Direct and by manual search. We used data of overall survival in sarcopenic patients for assessing the death risk. We extracted hazard ratio estimates from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for meta-analysis., RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were eligible for meta-analysis including a total of 2,521 lung cancer patients. Univariate meta-analysis revealed a two-fold increased death risk in sarcopenic patients; multivariate meta-analysis yielded a significant, three-fold elevated risk of death. This higher mortality is independent of tumour stage., CONCLUSION: Muscle loss is an independent risk factor for increased death risk in lung cancer patients independent of cancer stage. This argues for implementing screening for sarcopenia into cancer care. Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J. Delinasios), All rights reserved.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic neuromuscular junction disorder. LEMS presents with muscular weakness and fatigability, mainly involving the proximal lower limbs. There are 2 types of LEMS depending on the etiology: paraneoplastic and idiopathic. The paraneoplastic form, which constitutes more than a half of the cases, is mostly associated with intrathoracic neoplasms. Most cases are seen in patients with small cell lung cancer; other subtypes of lung cancer are extremely rare. In this article, we report a case of LEMS as a rare association with adenocarcinoma of the lung.

AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: We report on a 58-year-old patient with weight loss, weakness and polyarthralgia. She reported of recurrent drops, painful joints and muscle weakness., INVESTIGATIONS: The patient had swollen joints, clubbing and cachexia. The radiogram of the hands and feet showed a hypertrophic oseoarthropathy. In further investigations we found a tumor in the upper left lung. The histology findings showed a adenocarcinoma of the lung., DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: The diagnosis of a secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome) due to a adenocarcinoma of the lung was made. The patient refused a radiochemotherapy and decided to go on vacation. Further course is unknown., CONCLUSIONS: Arthralgia is a common symptom for medical consultation. Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome is a rare cause of paraneoplastic arthritis. Notice that unspecific symptoms like weakness, weight loss and arthritis may result from paraneoplastic tumor disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adult dermatomyositis is associated with cancer in 15 p. 100 to 50 p. 100 of cases and, hence, investigations should be systematically performed to search for cancer. A number of predictive factors have been reported. The aim of our study was to search for predictive factors of cancer, among adults with dermatomyositis., METHODS: We prospectively assessed 26 adults presenting with dermatomyositis, hospitalised in our department of dermatology from January 1993 to June 2000. The parameters assessed were: association with a cancer, age, gender, cutaneous necrosis, muscular weakness, electromyographic abnormalities, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and muscular enzyme levels., RESULTS: Mean age was of 52 years and sex ratio (M/F) was of 0.53. Cancers were diagnosed in eight cases (31 p. 100) (mean age: 59.5 years; sex ratio=1; cancer localization: lung (2), breast (2), ovary, endometrium, bladder, and melanoma). Five patients in the cancer group had cutaneous necrosis and only 2 in the without cancer (p=0.01; PPV=71.4 p.100). Elevation of muscular enzyme was also associated with cancer., CONCLUSION: Our report demonstrates that cutaneous necrosis is closely associated with cancer and it suggests that in selected patients with dermatomyositis and cutaneous necrosis, more exhaustive and repeated investigations should be performed to search for cancer. The interest of elevation in muscular enzyme as a predictive factor of cancer is discussed.

AB  - Implantation of a fast growing tumour to mice (Lewis lung carcinoma) resulted in a clear cachectic state characterized by a profound muscle wasting. This was accompanied by a significant increase in both UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression in skeletal muscle and heart. Interestingly, this increase in gene expression was not linked to a rise in circulating fatty acids or in a decrease in food intake, as previously reported in other pathophysiological states. These results question the concept that hyperlipaemia is the only factor controlling UCP gene expression in different pathophysiological conditions. In addition, the present work suggests that UCPs might participate in a counter-regulatory mechanism to lower the production of ROS.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Resveratrol has been reported to have antitumoural effects and recently it has been demonstrated that resveratrol partially blocks skeletal muscle wasting by interfering with NF-kappaB activation. We decided to investigate the potential anti-wasting properties of resveratrol on different models of cancer cachexia in experimental animals., METHODS AND RESULTS: Incubations of isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles in the presence of 30 microM of resveratrol caused a significant decrease in the rate of protein degradation. However, administration of resveratrol in vivo to both rats bearing the Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma (at the dose of 1 mg/kg body weight) and mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma (at two different doses, 5 and 25 mg/kg body weight) had no effect on skeletal muscle mass or body weight in tumour-bearing rodents. In addition, a combination of resveratrol (3 mg/kg body weight) and fish oil was also unable to induce any changes in skeletal muscle weights., CONCLUSIONS: It is therefore concluded from this study that resveratrol is unable to influence muscle mass in vivo and has no potential role as anticachectic agent for the treatment of muscle wasting associated with tumour growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a multiorganic syndrome associated with cancer, characterized by body weight loss, muscle and adipose tissue wasting and inflammation., METHODS: The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of the soluble receptor antagonist of myostatin (sActRIIB) in cachectic tumor-bearing animals analyzing changes in muscle proteolysis and in quality of life., RESULTS: Administration of sActRIIB resulted in an improvement in body and muscle weights. Administration of the soluble receptor antagonist of myostatin also resulted in an improvement in the muscle force., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that blocking myostatin pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer cachexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer wasting is characterized by muscle loss and may contribute to fatigue and poor quality of life (QoL). Our aim was to investigate associations between skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) and selected QoL outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at diagnosis., METHODS: Baseline data from patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and performance status 0-2 enrolled in three randomized trials of first-line chemotherapy (n = 1305) were analysed. Associations between SMI (cm2 /m2 ) and SMD (Hounsfield units) based on computed tomography-images at the third lumbar level and self-reported physical function (PF), role function (RF), global QoL, fatigue, and dyspnoea were investigated by linear regression using flexible non-linear modelling., RESULTS: Complete data were available for 734 patients, mean age 65 years. Mean SMI was 47.7 cm2 /m2 in men (n = 420) and 39.6 cm2 /m2 in women (n = 314). Low SMI values were non-linearly associated with low PF and RF (men P = 0.016/0.020, women P = 0.004/0.012) and with low global QoL (P = 0.001) in men. Low SMI was significantly associated with high fatigue (P = 0.002) and more pain (P = 0.015), in both genders, but not with dyspnoea. All regression analyses showed poorer physical outcomes below an SMI breakpoint of about 42-45 cm2 /m2 for men and 37-40 cm2 /m2 for women. In both genders, poor PF and more dyspnoea were significantly associated with low SMD., CONCLUSIONS: Low muscle mass in NSCLC negatively affects the patients' PF, RF, and global QoL, possibly more so in men than in women. However, muscle mass must be below a threshold value before this effect can be detected. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  -: Muscle wasting is a feature of the cachexia syndrome, which contributes significantly to the mortality of patients with cancer. We have previously demonstrated that miR-21 is secreted through extracellular vesicles (EV) by lung and pancreatic cancer cells and promotes JNK-dependent cell death through its binding to the TLR7 receptor in murine myoblasts. Here, we evaluate the ability of IMO-8503, a TLR7, 8, and 9 antagonist, to inhibit cancer-induced cachexia. Using EVs isolated from lung and pancreatic cancer cells and from patient plasma samples, we demonstrate that IMO-8503 inhibits cell death induced by circulating miRNAs with no significant toxicity. Intraperitoneal administration of the antagonist in a murine model for Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC-induced cachexia) strongly impaired several cachexia-related features, such as the expression of Pax7 as well as caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in skeletal muscles, and significantly prevented the loss of lean mass in tumor-bearing mice. IMO-8503 also impaired circulating miRNA-induced cell death in human primary myoblasts. Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that IMO-8503 serves as a potential therapy for the treatment of cancer cachexia. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer-associated cachexia is a significant problem for patients with cancer that remain poorly understood, understudied, and inadequately treated; these findings report a potential new therapeutic for the treatment of TLR7-mediated cancer cachexia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dyspnea is common in lung cancer and may be partially attributable to increased ventilatory drive due to muscle weakness. The sympathetic component of this pathway might be mitigated by beta-blockers., METHODS: A retrospective review of new patients with stage III-IV non-small lung cancer or any small cell lung cancer was undertaken to assess the impact of beta-blocker use on dyspnea and fatigue. Data were abstracted for clinical characteristics, beta-blocker use, and pre-treatment Edmonton Symptom Assessment System dyspnea and fatigue scores., RESULTS: Of 348 patients assessed, 202 met eligibility criteria. The median age was 67, 55.4% were female, 18.8% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 5.9% had active coronary artery disease. Over 60% of patients scored 4/10 or higher on their dyspnea and fatigue scores. While dyspnea and fatigue were moderately associated, no association was found between beta-blocker use and either symptom. Recorded dosages of beta-blockers were low. COPD was associated with dyspnea and fatigue, while anemia was associated with fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnea and fatigue are prevalent and increased in the presence of COPD and anemia. No association between beta-blocker use and dyspnea or fatigue scores was observed. This may be attributable to inadequate dosing or to retrospective bias.

AB  - Twenty-two patients undergoing thoracotomy for the diagnosis or treatment of a suspected pulmonary neoplasm had separate biopsies taken from their external and internal intercostal muscles at the time of surgery. Pulmonary function abnormalities ranged from none to moderate airway obstruction. Seventeen of the twenty-two patients had morphologic changes (targeting, variation in fiber size, splitting, and atrophy) in both respiratory muscles, but not in the control latissimus dorsi. Fiber atrophy was more marked in the internal intercostal muscle and was significantly related to the degree of airway obstruction, but not to age, malignancy, or weight loss. Biochemical analyses revealed decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PC) in 47 of 52 muscles, including the latissimus dorsi. The data suggested a relation between increasing airway obstruction and decreasing amounts of phosphocreatine in both intercostal muscles. This relationship may have been enhanced by the presence of malignancy or weight loss. There was a selective decrease in muscle glycogen found only in the external intercostal muscle that was not affected by airway obstruction, malignancy, or weight loss. Intercostal muscle abnormalities are common in patients with obstructive lung disease who undergo thoracotomy, and are probably multifactorial in origin. It is possible that these abnormalities affect the natural history of lung disease in some patients.

AB  - Overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-ski in mice results in the development of a hypertrophic phenotype, characterized by increases in body and muscle weights. It has been previously shown in our laboratories that down-regulation of muscle protein breakdown associated with reduced expression of genes pertaining to different proteolytic systems likely account for this hypertrophic pattern. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the resistance of c-ski transgenic mice to catabolic stimuli such as those induced by the growth of the Lewis lung carcinoma. The tumor elicited a loss of body weight either in transgenic or in non-transgenic animals, although it was less pronounced in the former. The mass of gastrocnemius, tibialis and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were significantly reduced in non-transgenic tumor-bearing mice. Despite the anabolic setting displayed by the transgenic animals, the EDL only is completely protected against wasting. Indeed, gastrocnemius, tibialis and soleus show a reduction in weight, the latter two being significantly more depleted when compared to the non-transgenic tumor bearers. Similarly, the perigenital white adipose tissue presented a reduced mass which was more marked in the transgenic group. The quantitation of gene expression for ubiquitin, E2, C8 and calpain in the EDL showed marked differences between the transgenic and the non-transgenic groups of tumor hosts. As expected from previous results, in the latter group most of the transcripts examined increased with respect to controls as a consequence of tumor growth; by contrast, in the transgenic tumor hosts there was a significant reduction of ubiquitin, E2, C8 subunit, and calpain mRNA levels in comparison with the transgenic tumor-free animals. These results show that c-ski hyperexpression prevents tumor-induced muscle wasting in the EDL muscle, likely by impairing the state of activation of different proteolytic systems. However, the lack of effectiveness in the other muscles examined suggests that the achievement of a significant interference with the development of cachexia at the molecular level is not an easy task and probably should be designed taking into consideration more than one target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia risk factors are poorly understood., METHODS: This study examines sarcopenia prevalence and risk factors in community-dwelling men (694) and women (1006) aged 55-98 years (mean=73) who attended a 1988-1992 Rancho Bernardo Study clinic visit. Height, weight, muscle strength, fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass by bioelectric impedance analysis, and grip strength were measured; alcohol and medication use, smoking, and physical activity were ascertained., RESULTS: Mean FFM was 43.5 kg for women and 61.7 kg for men. Sarcopenia, defined as FFM of > or =2.0 standard deviations below the gender-specific mean of a young reference population, was present in 6.0% overall. Prevalence increased dramatically from 4% of men and 3% of women aged 70-75 to 16% of men and 13% of women aged 85 and older. Both men and women with sarcopenia had a significantly lower fat mass and body mass index than those without sarcopenia. Men with sarcopenia were twice as likely to have fallen in the past year compared with those without sarcopenia. Grip strength, but not quadriceps strength, was lower in men and women with sarcopenia. Physically active women were about half as likely to have sarcopenia, but no association was found in men. Few men and women were current smokers, but they were more likely to have sarcopenia. Comorbidities (heart disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, arthritis, cancer) and medications (thyroid hormones, corticosteroids, and hormone replacement therapy) were not associated with sarcopenia., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia increases with age. This study also identified lack of physical activity and current smoking as reversible risk factors for sarcopenia.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare disease characterised by proximal muscle weakness and a typical cutaneous rash. The muscle biopsy shows inflammatory lesions consistent with myositis, being related to an increased risk of cancer, often considered as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The authors present a case of a 63-year-old man, with progressive proximal muscle weakness and cutaneous rash, appearing in two months. The muscle and skin biopsies were consistent with DM. Chest tomography showed a nodular image in the lingular region and bronchy biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This clinical case intends to enhance the importance of a thorough diagnostic study in patients with DM, as it is often a paraneoplastic syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, a putative role of systemic inflammation as a driver of pulmonary cachexia induced by either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or nonsmall cell lung cancer is reviewed. Gaps in current translational research approaches are discussed and alternative strategies are proposed to provide new insights., RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system has generally been considered a cause of pulmonary cachexia, but current animal models lack specificity and evidence is lacking in nonsmall cell lung cancer and conflicting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Recent studies have shown activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in both nonsmall cell lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Myonuclear loss, as a consequence of increased apoptotic events in myofibers, has been suggested in cancer-cachexia-associated muscle atrophy. Plasma transfer on myotube cultures can be used to detect early inflammatory signals in patients and presence of atrophy-inducing activity within the circulation., SUMMARY: Comparative clinical research between nonsmall cell lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different disease stages is useful to unravel disease-specific versus common denominators of pulmonary cachexia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of grip strength with disease specific incidence and mortality and whether grip strength enhances the prediction ability of an established office based risk score., DESIGN: Prospective population based study., SETTING: UK Biobank., PARTICIPANTS: 502 293 participants (54% women) aged 40-69 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality as well as incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer (all cancer, colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate)., RESULTS: Of the participants included in analyses, 13 322 (2.7%) died over a mean of 7.1 (range 5.3-9.9) years' follow-up. In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009)., CONCLUSION: Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for cachexia, which impairs disease prognosis, are limited. Muscle-enriched microRNAs and protein acetylation are involved in muscle wasting including lung cancer (LC) cachexia. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are involved in muscle metabolism. We hypothesized that muscle-enriched microRNA, protein hyperacetylation, and expression levels of myogenic transcription factors (MTFs) and downstream targets, muscle loss and function improve in LC cachectic Parp-1(-/-) and Parp-2(-/-) mice., METHODS: Body and muscle weights, grip strength, muscle phenotype, muscle-enriched microRNAs (miR-1, -133, -206, and -486), protein acetylation, acetylated levels of FoxO1, FoxO3, and PGC-1alpha, histone deacetylases (HDACs) including SIRT1, MTFs, and downstream targets (alpha-actin, PGC-1alpha, and creatine kinase) were evaluated in diaphragm and gastrocnemius of LC (LP07 adenocarcinoma) wild type (WT), Parp-1(-/-) and Parp-2-/- mice., RESULTS: Compared to WT cachectic animals, in both respiratory and limb muscles of Parp-1(-/-) and Parp-2(-/-) cachectic mice: downregulation of muscle-specific microRNAs was counterbalanced especially in gastrocnemius of Parp-1(-/-) mice; increased protein acetylation was attenuated (improvement in HDAC3, SIRT-1, and acetylated FoxO3 levels in both muscles, acetylated FoxO1 levels in the diaphragm); reduced MTFs and creatine kinase levels were mitigated; body and muscle weights, strength, and muscle fiber sizes improved, while tumor weight and growth decreased., CONCLUSIONS: These molecular findings may explain the improvements seen in body and muscle weights, limb muscle force and fiber sizes in both Parp-1(-/-) and Parp-2(-/-) cachectic mice., GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: PARP-1 and -2 play a role in cancer-induced cachexia, thus selective pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 and -2 may be of interest in clinical settings.

AB  - Strategies to treat cachexia are still at its infancy. Enhanced muscle protein breakdown and ubiquitin-proteasome system are common features of cachexia associated with chronic conditions including lung cancer (LC). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP), which play a major role in chromatin structure regulation, also underlie maintenance of muscle metabolism and body composition. We hypothesized that protein catabolism, proteolytic markers, muscle fiber phenotype, and muscle anabolism may improve in respiratory and limb muscles of LC-cachectic Parp-1-deficient (Parp-1-/- ) and Parp-2-/- mice. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of LC (LP07 adenocarcinoma) bearing mice (wild type, Parp-1-/- , and Parp-2-/- ), PARP activity (ADP-ribose polymers, pADPr), redox balance, muscle fiber phenotype, apoptotic nuclei, tyrosine release, protein ubiquitination, muscle-specific E3 ligases, NF-kappaB signaling pathway, markers of muscle anabolism (Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and mitochondrial DNA) were evaluated along with body and muscle weights, and limb muscle force. Compared to wild type cachectic animals, in both respiratory and limb muscles of Parp-1-/- and Parp-2-/- cachectic mice: cancer induced-muscle wasting characterized by increased PARP activity, protein oxidation, tyrosine release, and ubiquitin-proteasome system (total protein ubiquitination, atrogin-1, and 20S proteasome C8 subunit) were blunted, the reduction in contractile myosin and atrophy of the fibers was attenuated, while no effects were seen in other structural features (inflammatory cells, internal or apoptotic nuclei), and markers of muscle anabolism partly improved. Activation of either PARP-1 or -2 is likely to play a role in muscle protein catabolism via oxidative stress, NF-kappaB signaling, and enhanced proteasomal degradation in cancer-induced cachexia. Therapeutic potential of PARP activity inhibition deserves attention. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and muscles. Its pathophysiology is still very poorly understood, but humoral and cellular immune dysregulation is apparent. Diagnosis of DM is based on five criteria: proximal limb muscle weakness, serum muscle enzyme elevation, histopathologic muscle abnormalities on muscle biopsy, electromyographic abnormalities, and clinical inflammatory dermatological manifestations (heliotrope rash, poikiloderma, and inflammatory lesions on the hands and facing joints). DM is frequently associated with certain cancers, and may appear before, concurrent with, or after diagnosis of cancer. DM has been reported to be associated with approximately one per 1000 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Treatment is based on long-course nonselective immunosuppression, particularly corticosteroids, by general route, even when malignancy is present, but new-targeted therapies may modify the treatment strategy in the near future. Despite iatrogenic immunosuppression, the prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer is not worse in patients with paraneoplastic DM. We report one case as an illustration of this paraneoplastic course (evolving in parallel with the cancer), and to make an update on the state of knowledge on paraneoplastic DM in such cancers.

AB  - A patient with typical Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) has a clinical manifestation of proximal muscle weaknesses, a larger-than-100% incremental change in repetitive nerve stimulation on high-rate stimulation electrophysiological testing, and a paraneoplastic origin from small cell carcinoma of the lung. Here, we present a patient with an atypical myasthenic syndrome with an oculobulbar-predominant muscle involvement, a borderline incremental change in repetitive nerve stimulation at high frequencies, and a paraneoplastic origin from extrapulmonary mixed small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this report is to emphasize the importance of painstaking scrutiny in the examination of a patient with a less-common presentation of LEMS. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Loss of appetite, regardless of cause, is a significant symptom that may cause extreme weight loss in older patients. The consequences of anorexia include muscle wasting, weakness, depression, increased susceptibility to disease complications, and decreased immunocompetence. In the older population, the major causes of anorexia are pulmonary and cardiac diseases, cancer, dementia, alcoholism, depression, and medications. The diagnosis is based on the physical exam, a history of weight loss, and a review of dietary intake. Treatment strategies include managing GI disturbances, encouraging physical activity and socialization, reducing fatigue and food aversions, and adding high-calorie supplements to the diet.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is a complex disorder characterized by inflammatory responses, and it is associated with poor performance status and high mortality rate of cancer patients. Carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), a noncytotoxic chemotherapy agent, shows anti-inflammatory features in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we investigated the preventive and therapeutic effects of CAI on muscle loss that occurred in mice with advanced Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). The carcass weights of CAI-treated mice were significantly higher than that of mice in the vehicle group from Day 19 to the end of the study. The gastrocnemius and epididymal adipose tissue weights were also increased by CAI treatment. The protective mechanisms might be attributed to the following points: CAI treatment inhibited the proteolysis in muscles by decreasing expressions of muscle-specific FoxO3 transcription factor and ubiquitin E3 ligases (MuRF1 and atrogin1). Moreover, CAI restricted the NF-kappaB signaling, downregulated the level of TNF-alpha in muscle and both TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in serum, directly stimulated SIRT1 activity in vitro, and increased SIRT1 content in muscle. These results indicate that CAI can alleviate muscle wasting and is a promising drug against lung cancer cachexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia and muscle atrophy are common consequences of cancer and chemotherapy administration. The novel hormone ghrelin has been proposed as a treatment for this condition. Increases in food intake and direct effects on muscle proteolysis and protein synthesis are likely to mediate these effects, but the pathways leading to these events are not well understood., METHODS: We characterized molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy induced by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour implantation in c57/bl6 adult male mice and by administration of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin in mice and in C2C12 myotubes. The effects of exogenous ghrelin administration and its mechanisms of action were examined in these settings., RESULTS: Tumour implantation and cisplatin induced muscle atrophy by activating pro-inflammatory cytokines, p38-C/EBP-beta, and myostatin, and by down-regulating Akt, myoD, and myogenin, leading to activation of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis and muscle weakness. Tumour implantation also increased mortality. In vitro, cisplatin up-regulated myostatin and atrogin-1 by activating C/EBP-beta and FoxO1/3. Ghrelin prevented these changes in vivo and in vitro, significantly increasing muscle mass (P < 0.05 for LLC and P < 0.01 for cisplatin models) and grip strength (P = 0.038 for LLC and P = 0.001 for cisplatin models) and improving survival (P = 0.021 for LLC model)., CONCLUSION: Ghrelin prevents muscle atrophy by down-regulating inflammation, p38/C/EBP-beta/myostatin, and activating Akt, myogenin, and myoD. These changes appear, at least in part, to target muscle cells directly. Ghrelin administration in this setting is associated with improved muscle strength and survival. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - RATIONALE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have led to the development of new approaches for cancer treatment with positive outcomes. However, checkpoint blockade is associated with a unique spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which may cause irreversible neurological deficits and even death., PATIENT CONCERNS: We presented a case of a 57-year-old man with non-small-cell lung cancer.who developed ptosis, dyspnea, and muscle weakness as initial symptoms with progression after the treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab., DIAGNOSES: Myasthenia gravis was confirmed by serum acetylcholine receptor antibody and single fiber electromyography. Myositis was identified by high level of serum creatine phosphokinase and electromyography. Polyneuropathy was identified by nerve conduction study., INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent treatment with steroid and pyridostigmine. Respiratory rehabilitation was also performed., OUTCOMES: Dyspnea and muscle weakness improved gradually. Ipilimumab and nivolumab were permanently discontinued., LESSONS: This case has increased the clinical awareness by indicating that the checkpoint inhibitors-related neurological irAEs could be complicated and simultaneously involve multiple neurological systems. Early recognition and complete evaluation are critical in clinical practice. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sijunzi decoction is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) commonly used for invigorating vital energy and for the enhancement of immunity. Modified Sijunzi decoctions have been extensively used to treat cachexia and improve the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy., AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed to provide comprehensive evidence for the anti-cachectic effect of a modified Sijunzi decoction (Zhen-Qi; ZQ-SJZ) and characterize its anti-cachectic mechanism, especially in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-induced cancer cachectic mouse model to demonstrate the anti-cachectic effect of ZQ-SJZ. Moreover, we provided an in vitro C2C12 myotube formation model to investigate the effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy., RESULTS: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced body weight loss, intestinal mucosal damage, as well as forelimb grip strength and myofiber size. The administration of ZQ-SJZ also significantly prolonged the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, ZQ-SJZ increased the levels of myogenic proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and myogenin, and decreased the atrophy-related protein, atrogin-1, in cisplatin-treated C2C12 myotubes in vitro. In addition, cisplatin-induced mitochondria dysfunction could be hampered by the co-administration of ZQ-SJZ, by which it recovered the cisplatin-mediated decrease in PGC-1alpha and PKM1 levels., CONCLUSIONS: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachectic conditions and significantly prolong the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. The profound effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachexia may be due to its modulation of the mitochondrial function and subsequent myogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated the anti-cachectic mechanism of ZQ-SJZ and its potential use as a palliative strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.

AB  - Skeletal muscle atrophy, the most characteristic feature of cancer cachexia, often occurs in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) a widely used edible medical fungus, exhibits hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated whether combined treatment with the ethonolic extract of AC ameliorates cachexia symptoms, especially muscle wasting, in lung tumor-bearing mice treated with chemotherapy. Our results revealed that gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced severe body weight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy in the mice with cancer were greatly attenuated after AC extract administration. The protection may be attributed to the inhibition of skeletal muscle proteolysis by suppressing myostatin and activin release, muscle wasting-related FoxO3/MuRF-1/MAFbx signaling, proteasomal enzyme activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. A significant decrease in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression and formation was observed in the atrophying muscle of the conventional chemotherapy treatment group (CGC), and this decrease was markedly reversed by AC treatment. Additionally, the anorexia, intestinal injury and dysfunction that occurred in the CGC group were mitigated by AC extract. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the AC extract has a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced muscle atrophy mainly by attenuating muscle proteolysis, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and anorexia, and activating IGF-1-dependent protein synthesis.

AB  - Luteolin was recently demonstrated to suppress tumor growth by interfering with nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. As the NF-kappaB pathway plays a critical role in muscular atrophy associated with cancer cachexia, we aimed to investigate the potential of luteolin to alleviate cancer-associated cachexia in a Lewis lung cancer mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: A control group, a model group and a luteolin group. Mice in the model and luteolin groups received a subcutaneous injection of Lewis lung cancer cells, while the control group received PBS. Subsequently, the tumor mass, serum, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were collected on day 21. The serum, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were weighed and prepared for use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses. The results revealed that the tumor-free body mass was significantly reduced in tumor-bearing mice compared with that of mice in the other groups. The gastrocnemius muscle mass and heart mass were greater in the luteolin treatment group than in the control group. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were lower in the luteolin treatment group than in the model group. In addition, according to the results of the WB and qRT-PCR analyses, the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase muscle RING finger-containing protein 1 (MuRF1) was downregulated in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, whereas atrogin-1 was downregulated only in skeletal muscle in the luteolin treatment group vs. the model group. Furthermore, IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) and phospho-p65 were significantly downregulated in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue, whereas the expression of p-p38 was downregulated only in skeletal muscle in the luteolin treatment group when compared with their expression levels in the model group, as determined by the WB analysis. In conclusion, from the current results, we conclude that luteolin is able to reduce inflammatory burden, downregulate the expression of genes associated with muscle protein breakdown, and protect skeletal and heart muscle from cancer-induced wasting and loss in vivo. Therefore, luteolin has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-cachetic agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome affecting more than 50% of patients with advanced cancer and responsible for ~20% of cancer-associated deaths, is still a poorly understood process without a standard cure available. Skeletal muscle atrophy caused by systemic inflammation is a major clinical feature of cachexia, leading to weight loss, dampening patients' quality of life, and reducing patients' response to anticancer therapy. RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) is a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily and a mediator of muscle regeneration, inflammation, and cancer., METHODS: By using murine models consisting in the injection of colon 26 murine adenocarcinoma (C26-ADK) or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells in BALB/c and C57BL/6 or Ager-/- (RAGE-null) mice, respectively, we investigated the involvement of RAGE signalling in the main features of cancer cachexia, including the inflammatory state. In vitro experiments were performed using myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts or primary myoblasts isolated from C57BL/6 wild type and Ager-/- mice treated with the RAGE ligand, S100B (S100 calcium-binding protein B), TNF (tumor necrosis factor)alpha+/-IFN (interferon) gamma, and tumour cell- or masses-conditioned media to analyse hallmarks of muscle atrophy. Finally, muscles of wild type and Ager-/- mice were injected with TNFalpha/IFNgamma or S100B in a tumour-free environment., RESULTS: We demonstrate that RAGE is determinant to activate signalling pathways leading to muscle protein degradation in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and/or tumour-derived cachexia-inducing factors. We identify the RAGE ligand, S100B, as a novel factor able to induce muscle atrophy per se via a p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase)/myogenin axis and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-dependent MyoD (myoblast determination protein 1) degradation. Lastly, we found that in cancer conditions, an increase in serum levels of tumour-derived S100B and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) occurs leading to chronic activation/overexpression of RAGE, which induces hallmarks of cancer cachexia (i.e. muscle wasting, systemic inflammation, and release of tumour-derived pro-cachectic factors). Absence of RAGE in mice translates into reduced serum levels of cachexia-inducing factors, delayed loss of muscle mass and strength, reduced tumour progression, and increased survival., CONCLUSIONS: RAGE is a molecular determinant in inducing the hallmarks of cancer cachexia, and molecular targeting of RAGE might represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent or counteract the cachectic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with lung cancer often experience a reduction in exercise tolerance, muscle weakness and decreased quality of life. Although the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation programs is well recognized in other forms of cancers and in many pulmonary diseases, few researchers have studied its impact in patients with lung cancer, particularly in those awaiting lung resection surgery (LRS)., OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of a short, home-based exercise training program (HBETP) with patients under investigation for non-small cell lung cancer and potential candidates for LRS, and to determine the effectiveness of this program on exercise tolerance, skeletal muscle strength and quality of life., METHODS: Sixteen patients with lung cancer awaiting LRS participated in a four-week HBETP including moderate aerobic activities (walking and cycling) and muscle training performed three times weekly. Before and after the intervention, a cardiopulmonary exercise test, a 6 min walk test and the assessment of muscle strength and quality of life were performed., RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed the four-week HBETP and all the patients completed >75% of the prescribed exercise sessions. The duration of the cycle endurance test (264+/-79 s versus 421+/-241 s; P<0.05) and the 6 min walk test distance (540+/-98 m versus 568+/-101 m; P<0.05) were significantly improved. Moreover, the strength of the deltoid, triceps and hamstrings were significantly improved ( post-pre training 1.82+/-2.83 kg, 1.32+/-1.75 kg and 3.41+/-3.7 kg; P<0.05, respectively)., CONCLUSION: In patients with lung cancer awaiting LRS, HBETP was feasible and improved exercise tolerance and muscle strength. This may be clinically relevant because poor exercise capacity and muscle weakness are predictors of postoperative complications.

AB  - Atrophy occurs in specific muscles with inactivity (for example, during plaster cast immobilization) or denervation (for example, in patients with spinal cord injuries). Muscle wasting occurs systemically in older people (a condition known as sarcopenia); as a physiological response to fasting or malnutrition; and in many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cancer-associated cachexia, diabetes, renal failure, cardiac failure, Cushing syndrome, sepsis, burns and trauma. The rapid loss of muscle mass and strength primarily results from excessive protein breakdown, which is often accompanied by reduced protein synthesis. This loss of muscle function can lead to reduced quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality. Exercise is the only accepted approach to prevent or slow atrophy. However, several promising therapeutic agents are in development, and major advances in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate the protein balance in muscle include the identification of several cytokines, particularly myostatin, and a common transcriptional programme that promotes muscle wasting. Here, we discuss these new insights and the rationally designed therapies that are emerging to combat muscle wasting.

AB  - Quantitative measurement was made of body composition in patients with several forms of neoplastic disease. Total body nitrogen was determined by means of the prompt gamma neutron activation technique; total body potassium was measured with the use of a whole body counter. The mass and protein content of the muscle compartment and nonmuscle lean tissue were estimated by application of the technique of compartmental analysis. Total body water, determined simultaneously with the use of tritium label, provided a measure of lean body mass. From these data, the body fat can be inferred. The prompt gamma neutron activation and whole body counting techniques represent a considerable advance over the balance and radioisotope techniques used in earlier studies. The new techniques make possible sequential studies over prolonged periods of time with a considerable degree of accuracy. The loss of body weight by patients with solid tumors consisted primarily of the loss of muscle mass and body fat. Even in severe wasting, the patients appear to retain significant amounts of body fat. It is the skeletal muscle which is predominantly lost; the visceral life-supporting system is, to a considerable extent, spared. The nonmuscle tissue including the visceral fraction did not change in this study, and actually appeared to increase in size when comparison was made with the normal contrast population. The loss of total body water was slight in the cancer patients studied.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is growing awareness of the relationship between sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function), and outcomes in cancer, making it a potential target for future therapies. In order to inform future research and practice, we undertook a systematic review of factors associated with loss of muscle mass, and the relationship between muscle function and muscle mass in lung cancer, a common condition associated with poor outcomes., DESIGN: We conducted a computerised systematic literature search on five databases. Studies were included if they explored muscle mass as an outcome measure in patients with lung cancer, and were published in English., SETTING: Secondary care., PARTICIPANTS: Patients with lung cancer., PRIMARY OUTCOME: Factors associated with loss of muscle mass and muscle function, or sarcopenia, and the clinical impact thereof in patients with lung cancer., RESULTS: We reviewed 5726 citations, and 35 articles were selected for analysis. Sarcopenia, as defined by reduced muscle mass alone, was found to be very prevalent in patients with lung cancer, regardless of body mass index, and where present was associated with poorer functional status and overall survival. There were diverse studies exploring molecular and metabolic factors in the development of loss of muscle mass; however, the precise mechanisms that contribute to sarcopenia and cachexia remain uncertain. The effect of nutritional supplements and ATP infusions on muscle mass showed conflicting results. There are very limited data on the correlation between degree of sarcopenia and muscle function, which has a non-linear relationship in older non-cancer populations., CONCLUSIONS: Loss of muscle mass is a significant contributor to morbidity in patients with lung cancer. Loss of muscle mass and function may predate clinically overt cachexia, underlining the importance of evaluating sarcopenia, rather than weight loss alone. Understanding this relationship and its associated factors will provide opportunities for focused intervention to improve clinical outcomes.

Alongside muscle mass, assessment of muscle strength or physical performance is essential for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevalent form of cancer with high mortality, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) is commonly used to assess patients' suitability for treatment. However, a significant proportion of patients with good PS are unable to complete multidisciplinary team (MDT)-planned treatment. Little is known about the ability of objective measurements of physical performance in predicting patients' ability to complete MDT-planned treatment and outcomes in NSCLC., OBJECTIVES: We sought to establish whether physical performance, utilising the short physical performance battery (SPPB), alongside muscle mass measurements, was able to predict receipt and completion of MDT-planned treatment, with a focus on chemotherapy in NSCLC., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants with NSCLC treated through a single lung cancer MDT and ECOG PS 0-2 were recruited and the following assessed: body composition [bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset], physical performance (SPPB), PS and nutritional status. We recorded receipt and completion of chemotherapy, as well as any adverse effects, hospitalisations, and treatment delays., RESULTS: We included a total of 62 participants with NSCLC, and in 26 of these, the MDT-planned treatment was chemotherapy. Participants with earlier stage disease and weight loss of <10% were more likely to complete MDT-planned treatment (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). Patients with a higher total SPPB score were more likely to complete more cycles of chemotherapy as well as the full course. Quicker gait speeds and sit-to-stand times were associated with completion of three or more cycles of chemotherapy (all p < 0.05). For every unit increase in SPPB score, there was a 28.2% decrease in adverse events, hospitalisations and delays of chemotherapy (incidence rate ratio 0.718, p = 0.001), whilst ECOG PS showed no correlation with these outcomes., CONCLUSION: Assessing physical performance by SPPB is quick and simple to do in clinical settings and may give better indication of likely chemotherapy treatment course completion than muscle mass alone and ECOG PS. In turn, this may identify specific targets for early functional intervention and impact on MDT decision-making and prudent use of resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently presents in advanced stages. A significant proportion of those with reportedly good ECOG performance status (PS) fail to receive planned multidisciplinary team (MDT) treatment, often for functional reasons, but an objective decline in physical performance is not well described. Sarcopenia, or loss of muscle mass, is an integral part of cancer cachexia. However, changes in both muscle mass and physical performance may predate clinically overt cachexia, and may be present even with normal body mass index. Physical fitness for treatment is currently subjectively assessed by means of the PS score, which may be inadequate in predicting tolerance to treatment. This study aims to evaluate whether measuring physical performance and muscle mass at baseline in NSCLC patients, in addition to PS score, is able to predict commencement and successful completion of MDT-planned treatment., METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-centre exploratory study of NSCLC patients attending a Rapid Access Lung Cancer clinic. Baseline data collected are (methods in brackets): physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance +/- dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), patient and physician-assessed PS (ECOG and Karnofsky), nutritional status and presence of cachexia. Longitudinal data consists of receipt and completion of MDT treatment plan. The primary outcome measure is commencement of MDT-planned treatment, and important secondary outcomes include successful completion of treatment, length of stay in surgical patients, and risk of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-related side effects., DISCUSSION: A more comprehensive assessment of phenotype, particularly with regards to physical performance and muscle mass, will provide additional discriminatory information of patients' fitness for treatment. If positive, this study has the potential to identify targets for early intervention in those who are at risk of deterioration. This will subsequently enable optimisation of performance of patients with NSCLC, in anticipation of systemic treatment.

AB  - Cancer patients commonly suffer from cachexia, a syndrome in which tumors induce metabolic changes in the host that lead to massive loss in skeletal muscle mass. Using a preclinical mouse model of cancer cachexia, we tested the hypothesis that tumor inoculation causes a reduction in ATP synthesis and genome-wide aberrant expression in skeletal muscle. Mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinomas were examined by in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We examined ATP synthesis rate and the expression of genes that play key-regulatory roles in skeletal muscle metabolism. Our in vivo NMR results showed reduced ATP synthesis rate in tumor-bearing (TB) mice relative to control (C) mice, and were cross-validated with whole genome transcriptome data showing atypical expression levels of skeletal muscle regulatory genes such as peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor gamma coactivator 1 s (PGC-1s), a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). Aberrant pattern of gene expression was also associated with genes involved in inflammation and immune response, protein and lipid catabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and uncoupling, and inadequate oxidative stress defenses, and these effects led to cachexia. Our findings suggest that reduced ATP synthesis is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to skeletal muscle wasting and thus advance our understanding of skeletal muscle dysfunction suffered by cancer patients. This study represents a new line of research that can support the development of novel therapeutics in the molecular medicine of skeletal muscle wasting. Such therapeutics would have wide-spread applications not only for cancer patients, but also for many individuals suffering from other chronic or endstage diseases that exhibit muscle wasting, a condition for which only marginally effective treatments are currently available.

AB  - The classical definition of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as a lung condition characterized by irreversible airway obstruction is outdated. The systemic involvement in patients with COPD, as well as the interactions between COPD and its comorbidities, justify the description of chronic systemic inflammatory syndrome. The pathogenesis of COPD is closely linked with aging, as well as with cardiovascular, endocrine, musculoskeletal, renal, and gastrointestinal pathologies, decreasing the quality of life of patients with COPD and, furthermore, complicating the management of the disease. The most frequently described comorbidities include skeletal muscle wasting, cachexia (loss of fat-free mass), lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell), pulmonary hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, normocytic anemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and arthritis. These complex interactions are based on chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, chronic hypoxia, and multiple common predisposing factors, and are currently under intense research. This review article is an overview of the comorbidities of COPD, as well as their interaction and influence on mutual disease progression, prognosis, and quality of life.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Defining the nature of the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic conditions is of primary importance to improve the health status of COPD patients through the optimal care of comorbidities. We aimed at providing a reasoned guide to understand, recognize and treat comorbidity of COPD with the perspective of shifting from comorbidity to multimorbidity., RECENT FINDINGS: Select comorbidities, such as atherosclerotic disease, depression, chronic kidney disease, cognitive impairment, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, lung cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, heart failure, sarcopenia, aortic aneurysm, arrhythmias and pulmonary embolism are highly prevalent among older COPD patients. Several concerns may affect the management of older COPD patients with comorbidity (e.g. the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD and cardiovascular diseases or concerns about the cardiovascular safety of inhaled COPD drugs)., SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that systemic inflammation may be the link between COPD and comorbidities, but this issue is still debated. Whatever the mechanism underlying comorbidities in COPD may be, it has an important clinical, prognostic and therapeutic impact. Nevertheless, clinical practice guidelines do not take into account comorbidities in their recommendations. Additionally, clinical trials investigating COPD treatment in the context of multimorbidity and considering geriatric outcomes are also distinctly lacking.

AB  - Sarcopenia represents one of the hallmarks of all chronic diseases, including cancer, and was already investigated as a prognostic marker in the pre-immunotherapy era. Sarcopenia can be evaluated using cross-sectional image analysis of CT-scans, at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3), to estimate the skeletal muscle index (SMI), a surrogate of skeletal muscle mass, and to evaluate the skeletal muscle density (SMD). We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive advanced cancer patient treated with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Baseline SMI and SMD were evaluated and optimal cut-offs for survival, according to sex and BMI (+/-25) were computed. The evaluated clinical outcomes were: objective response rate (ORR), immune-related adverse events (irAEs), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). From April 2015 to April 2019, 100 consecutive advanced cancer patients were evaluated. 50 (50%) patients had a baseline low SMI, while 51 (51%) had a baseline low SMD according to the established cut offs. We found a significant association between SMI and ECOG-PS (p = 0.0324), while no correlations were found regarding SMD and baseline clinical factors. The median follow-up was 20.3 months. Patients with low SMI had a significantly shorter PFS (HR = 1.66 [95% CI: 1.05-2.61]; p = 0.0291) at univariate analysis, but not at the multivariate analysis. They also had a significantly shorter OS (HR = 2.19 [95% CI: 1.31-3.64]; p = 0.0026). The multivariate analysis confirmed baseline SMI as an independent predictor for OS (HR = 2.19 [1.31-3.67]; p = 0.0027). We did not find significant relationships between baseline SMD and clinical outcomes, nor between ORR, irAEs and baseline SMI (data not shown). Low SMI is associated with shortened survival in advanced cancer patients treated with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors. However, the lack of an association between SMI and clinical response suggests that sarcopenia may be generally prognostic in this setting rather than specifically predictive of response to immunotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and muscle tissue degradation are hallmarks of the majority of chronic diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A computed tomography scan could be an easy modality to estimate the skeletal muscle mass through cross-sectional image analysis at the level of the third lumbar vertebra., METHODS: Baseline skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was evaluated through the skeletal muscle index (SMI), together with skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD), in NSCLC patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy to evaluate correlations with safety and clinical outcomes. When SMIs at different time points were available, further comparison was made between patients with worse and improved SMIs., RESULTS: Among 81 stage IV NSCLC patients, 28 had low SMM and 23 had low SMD. There were no significant differences in univariate analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM (P = 0.06388) or between patients with low and non-low SMD (P = 0.9126). Baseline low SMM, however, proved a significant predictor of shorter PFS in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.93; P = 0.0278), but not low SMD. There were no differences in overall survival (OS) between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM or low and non-low SMD. No differences in PFS and OS between evaluable patients with worse or improved SMI were found. A significant difference in hematological toxicities between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM (P = 0.0358) was observed., CONCLUSIONS: Low SMM is predictive of shorter PFS, while consecutive changes in muscular mass do not seem to be a predictor of PFS or OS. The role of muscle radiodensity remains a matter of debate. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Thoracic Cancer published by China Lung Oncology Group and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Sarcopenia represents one of the hallmarks of all chronic disease, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A computed tomography scan is an easy modality to estimate the skeletal muscle mass through cross-sectional image analysis at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Baseline skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was evaluated using gender-specific cutoffs for skeletal muscle index in NSCLC patients administered immunotherapy with nivolumab to evaluate its possible correlations with clinical outcomes. From April 2015 to August 2018, 23 stage IV NSCLC patients were eligible for image analysis. Nine patients (39.1%) had low SMM. Among patients with baseline low and non-low SMM, median progression free survival was 3.1 and 3.8 months, respectively (P = 0.0560), while median overall survival was 4.1 and 13 months, respectively (P = 0.2866). This hypothesis-generating preliminary report offers the opportunity to speculate about the negative influence of sarcopenia on immune response. In our opinion, nutritional status could affect the clinical outcomes of immunotherapy, even if we cannot make definitive conclusions here. Further studies on the topic are required.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is now considered as a systemic disease originating in the lungs. The natural history of this disease reveals numerous extrapulmonary manifestations and co-morbidity factors that complicate the evolution of COPD. Recent publications have documented these systemic manifestations and co-morbidities and clarified somewhat the role of muscle dysfunction, nutritional anomalies, endocrine dysfunction, anaemia, osteoporosis and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders as well as lung cancer and psychological elements in this complex disease. Importantly, recent studies have shown that effort intolerance, exertional desaturation, loss of autonomy and reduced physical activity, loss of muscle mass and quadriceps strength as well as dyspnoea and impaired quality of life can be considered as independent predictive factors for survival in COPD. Use of these data may advance understanding of mechanisms; improve evaluation and thereby patient management in COPD.

AB  - Metastatic infiltration of a peripheral plexus, also named metastatic plexopathy (MP), often results in severe pain and muscular weakness. This rather rare event may have a dramatic impact on the quality of life of patients affected by cancer. We hereby report a rare case of painful MP of the left cervicobrachial plexus presenting as the inaugural manifestation of poorly differentiated large-cell lung carcinoma in a 53-year-old patient. This responsible lung carcinoma was fortuitously diagnosed during MRI of the brachial plexus (BP). Complementary cancer staging was completed by contrast-enhanced multidetector CT, 18-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT and colour Doppler ultrasound of the BP. Although MRI remains the gold standard method for imaging the BP, our reported case emphasizes the alternative diagnostic capabilities of contrast-enhanced multidetector CT and ultrasound and confirms the high specificity of 18-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT in distinguishing brachial MP from secondary radiation plexopathy.

AB  - Muscle wasting in cancer is a common and often occult condition that can occur prior to overt signs of weight loss and before a clinical diagnosis of cachexia can be made. Muscle wasting in cancer is an important and independent predictor of progressive functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Although several therapeutic agents are currently in development for the treatment of muscle wasting or cachexia in cancer, the majority of these agents do not directly inhibit muscle loss. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have the potential to increase lean body mass (LBM) and hence muscle mass, without the untoward side effects seen with traditional anabolic agents. Enobosarm, a nonsteroidal SARM, is an agent in clinical development for prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer (POWER 1 and 2 trials). The POWER trials are two identically designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, and multinational phase 3 trials to assess the efficacy of enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in subjects initiating first-line chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To assess enobosarm's effect on both prevention and treatment of muscle wasting, no minimum weight loss is required. These pivotal trials have pioneered the methodological and regulatory fields exploring a therapeutic agent for cancer-associated muscle wasting, a process hereby described. In each POWER trial, subjects will receive placebo (n = 150) or enobosarm 3 mg (n = 150) orally once daily for 147 days. Physical function, assessed as stair climb power (SCP), and LBM, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), are the co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials assessed at day 84. Based on extensive feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the co-primary endpoints will be analyzed as a responder analysis. To be considered a physical function responder, a subject must have >=10 % improvement in physical function compared to baseline. To meet the definition of response on LBM, a subject must have demonstrated no loss of LBM compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints include durability of response assessed at day 147 in those responding at day 84. A combined overall survival analysis for both studies is considered a key secondary safety endpoint. The POWER trials design was established with extensive clinical input and collaboration with regulatory agencies. The efficacy endpoints are a result of this feedback and discussion of the threshold for clinical benefit in patients at risk for muscle wasting. Full results from these studies will soon be published and will further guide the development of future anabolic trials.

AB  - Outcomes for patients with lung cancer have been improved substantially through the integration of surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy for patients with early-stage disease. Meanwhile, advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms have substantially advanced our treatment of patients with advanced lung cancer through the introduction of targeted therapies, immune approaches, improvements in chemotherapy, and better supportive care. However, the majority of these advances have occurred among patients with good functional status, normal organ function, and with the social and economic support systems to be able to benefit most from these treatments. The aim of this article is to bring greater attention to management of lung cancer in patients who are medically compromised, which remains a major barrier to care delivery. Impaired performance status is associated with poor outcomes and correlates with the high prevalence of cachexia among patients with advanced lung cancer. CT imaging is emerging as a research tool to quantify muscle loss in patients with cancer, and new therapeutics are on the horizon that may provide important adjunctive therapy in the future. The benefits of cancer therapy for patients with organ failure are poorly understood because of their exclusion from clinical trials. The availability of targeted therapy and immunotherapy may provide alternatives that may be easier to deliver in this population, but clinical trials of these new agents in this population are vital. Patients with lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by lung cancer because of higher rates of tobacco addiction and the impact of socioeconomic status on delay in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. For all patients who are medically compromised with lung cancer, multidisciplinary approaches are particularly needed to evaluate these patients and to incorporate rapidly changing therapeutics to improve outcomes.

AB  - Pulmonary rehabilitation represents a modern therapeutic approach of respiratory diseases, with a multidisciplinary character, including: physical training, therapeutic education, psychosocial counseling, and nutritional approach. Pulmonary rehabilitation addresses to any patient suffering from pulmonary pathology whose quality of life is affected by the respiratory symptoms, regardless of the degree of functional impairment. This article is an analysis of evidences from the medical literature on outcomes of rehabilitation programs conducted in various lung diseases. The main indication of pulmonary rehabilitation is the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD (stable state and exacerbation) in which most studies were carried out. Pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with other respiratory pathology has its reason in the pathophysiological changes that they undergo (impaired lung function and gas exchange, muscle atrophy and deconditioning etc.) leading to symptoms, lower exercise tolerance and decrease daily physical activity, all of which ultimately result in impaired quality of life. The role of rehabilitation is reviewed in the following diseases: post-surgical lung volume reduction for emphysema, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, neuromuscular disease, intensive care, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, post-tuberculous sequelae, lung transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare condition, which may mimic myopathy. A few reports have described that EMG in LEMS may show changes compatible with myopathy, and muscle biopsies have been described with type II as well as type I atrophy. The EMG results were, however, based on qualitative EMG examination and the histopathological methods were not always clear. The objective of this study was to investigate if the previous EMG findings could be confirmed with quantitative EMG (QEMG) and to describe muscle histology in LEMS., METHODS: QEMG, nerve conduction studies and muscle biopsy were performed in four consecutive LEMS patients., RESULTS: QEMG showed significantly decreased mean MUP duration and muscle biopsy showed marked type II fiber atrophy., CONCLUSION: EMG and biopsy abnormalities mimicking myopathy may often be found in patients with LEMS., SIGNIFICANCE: LEMS is a debilitating, but treatable disease, which often precedes detection of a malignancy and it is therefore of obvious importance to diagnose these patients with speed and certainty. Hence it is important that neurophysiologists and neurologists are aware that EMG and histological abnormalities mimicking myopathy may be found in LEMS patients so that these findings do not prolong or misdirect the diagnostic process in these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: The cancer cachexia syndrome is characterized by anorexia, weight loss with muscle wasting and increased energy expenditure. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but its aetiology is poorly understood and no effective therapeutic intervention is available. It may result from an imbalance between the activity or effect of anabolic and catabolic hormones, mediated by the inflammatory cytokines. IGF-I is a potent anabolic agent, with therapeutic potential. Our objective was to investigate the role and regulation of the IGF system in cancer cachexia., DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We set up a prospective study of 30 patients with newly diagnosed unresectable non-small cell lung cancer, together with a cross-sectional comparison group of healthy volunteers., MEASUREMENTS: We examined the relationship between aspects of the IGF system, including IGFBP-3 proteolysis (using Western ligand and immunoblotting and an in vitro IGFBP-3 protease assay); the inflammatory cytokines and their soluble receptors; and food intake and nutritional status (including biochemical and anthropometric assessments)., RESULTS: Although we did not observe a marked reduction in food intake in the cancer patients, the majority lost weight and functionally important lean body mass. We observed GH resistance in the cancer patients, and intermittent proteolysis of IGFBP-3, which correlated with the circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration. The pattern of IGFBP-3 proteolysis was unusual, with a prominent 17-kDa fragment. Less IGFBP-3 proteolysis was associated with more weight loss, suggesting that this could be a protective counter-regulatory mechanism, increasing IGF-I bioavailability to the tissues., CONCLUSIONS: Cancer cachexia in humans is a complex condition. Patients tend to be GH resistant. The significance of the intermittent increases in IGFBP-3 proteolysis, which may be regulated by IL-6, remains uncertain. A better understanding of the pathophysiology should enable the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Cachexia is a syndrome characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with poor patient prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, prognostic cachexia biomarkers in NSCLC are unknown. Here, we analyzed computed tomography (CT) images and tumor transcriptome data to identify potentially secreted cachexia biomarkers (PSCB) in NSCLC patients with low-muscularity. We integrated radiomics features (pectoralis muscle, sternum, and tenth thoracic (T10) vertebra) from CT of 89 NSCLC patients, which allowed us to identify an index for screening muscularity. Next, a tumor transcriptomic-based secretome analysis from these patients (discovery set) was evaluated to identify potential cachexia biomarkers in patients with low-muscularity. The prognostic value of these biomarkers for predicting recurrence and survival outcome was confirmed using expression data from eight lung cancer datasets (validation set). Finally, C2C12 myoblasts differentiated into myotubes were used to evaluate the ability of the selected biomarker, interleukin (IL)-8, in inducing muscle cell atrophy. We identified 75 over-expressed transcripts in patients with low-muscularity, which included IL-6, CSF3, and IL-8. Also, we identified NCAM1, CNTN1, SCG2, CADM1, IL-8, NPTX1, and APOD as PSCB in the tumor secretome. These PSCB were capable of distinguishing worse and better prognosis (recurrence and survival) in NSCLC patients. IL-8 was confirmed as a predictor of worse prognosis in all validation sets. In vitro assays revealed that IL-8 promoted C2C12 myotube atrophy. Tumors from low-muscularity patients presented a set of upregulated genes encoding for secreted proteins, including pro-inflammatory cytokines that predict worse overall survival in NSCLC. Among these upregulated genes, IL-8 expression in NSCLC tissues was associated with worse prognosis, and the recombinant IL-8 was capable of triggering atrophy in C2C12 myotubes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and cachexia were a frequent problem in lung cancer and increases the risks of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is easy, non-invasive and reproducible method that can be performed., AIM: Evaluate nutritional status in patients with primary lung cancer by Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), BIA and anthropometric values (weight, arm and calf circumferences) and correlate the nutritional parameters to severity of cancer and histopathology., METHODS: The nutritional status of 73 cases of primary lung cancer was evaluated by anthropometric parameters, MNA test and impedencemetrie Results: According to body mass index (BMI), malnutrition, overweight and obesity were noted in 34,2%, 13,7% and 5,5%. According to BMI, free-fat mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI), the investigations occurred malnutrition and depletion of muscle in respectively 19,2% and 23,3% of cases. Fat depletion was noted in 21,9%. Overweight and obesity were detected in 6,8% and 5,5% of cases. Assessment by MNA, revealed that 28,7% of patients were already malnourished and 49,3% of patients were at risk of malnutrition. A significant correlation existed between the score of MNA and arm and calf circumferences, FFMI and FMI. FMI was significantly lower in group of patients with small lung carcinoma., CONCLUSION: Only FFMI allows early detection of malnutrition in cancer patients overestimated by measuring BMI and arm circumference was the better indicator of depletion of muscle.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Paraneoplastic syndrome is a disease or symptom that is the consequence of cancer in the body but, unlike mass effect, is not due to the local presence of cancer cells. An overlap of two paraneoplastic syndromes secondary to lung cancer in a patient is very rare. In order to improve the diagnosis of two paraneoplastic syndromes secondary to lung cancer, we reported an overlap of two paraneoplastic syndromes secondary to lung squamous carcinoma in a patient., METHODS: We reported a case of a 60-year-old male smoker who presented multiple erythematous lesions for 6 months with progressive proximal muscular weakness, and developed to dysphonia in 2 months. His chest computed tomography showed a spiculate pulmonary nodule near the hilar in the right upper lobe and mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement. Lung biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's blood test revealed elevated creatine kinase levels. Electromyography results were consistent with moderate myopathy accompanied with a pattern suggestive of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome., RESULTS: So we made the diagnosis of an overlap of two paraneoplastic syndromes (dermatomyositis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) secondary to lung squamous carcinoma., CONCLUSION: Recognition of paraneoplastic syndrome is crucial for early diagnosis of lung cancer because up to 80% of patients may present paraneoplastic syndromes before any other direct indication of malignancy. Early diagnosis and treatment of paraneoplastic syndrome is also important because delayed diagnosis may result in rapid disease progression and irreversible neurological damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia, also known as muscle wasting, is a complex metabolic condition characterized by loss of skeletal muscle and a decline in physical function. Muscle wasting is associated with cancer, sarcopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, and other chronic conditions and results in significant morbidity and mortality. GTx-024 (enobosarm) is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that has tissue-selective anabolic effects in muscle and bone, while sparing other androgenic tissue related to hair growth in women and prostate effects in men. GTx-024 has demonstrated promising pharmacologic effects in preclinical studies and favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in phase I investigation. METHODS: A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial was conducted to evaluate GTx-024 in 120 healthy elderly men (>60 years of age) and postmenopausal women. The primary endpoint was total lean body mass assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and secondary endpoints included physical function, body weight, insulin resistance, and safety. RESULTS: GTx-024 treatment resulted in dose-dependent increases in total lean body mass that were statistically significant (P < 0.001, 3 mg vs. placebo) and clinically meaningful. There were also significant improvements in physical function (P = 0.013, 3 mg vs. placebo) and insulin resistance (P = 0.013, 3 mg vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: GTx-024 showed a dose-dependent improvement in total lean body mass and physical function and was well tolerated. GTx-024 may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of muscle wasting associated with cancer and other chronic diseases.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) as emerging agents in late-stage clinical development for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting associated with cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Muscle wasting, including a loss of skeletal muscle, is a cancer-related symptom that begins early in the progression of cancer and affects a patient's quality of life, ability to tolerate chemotherapy, and survival. SARMs increase muscle mass and improve physical function in healthy and diseased individuals, and potentially may provide a new therapy for muscle wasting and cancer cachexia. SARMs modulate the same anabolic pathways targeted with classical steroidal androgens, but within the dose range in which expected effects on muscle mass and function are seen androgenic side-effects on prostate, skin, and hair have not been observed. Unlike testosterone, SARMs are orally active, nonaromatizable, nonvirilizing, and tissue-selective anabolic agents., SUMMARY: Recent clinical efficacy data for LGD-4033, MK-0773, MK-3984, and enobosarm (GTx-024, ostarine, and S-22) are reviewed. Enobosarm, a nonsteroidal SARM, is the most well characterized clinically, and has consistently demonstrated increases in lean body mass and better physical function across several populations along with a lower hazard ratio for survival in cancer patients. Completed in May 2013, results for the Phase III clinical trials entitled Prevention and treatment Of muscle Wasting in patiEnts with Cancer1 (POWER1) and POWER2 evaluating enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer will be available soon, and will potentially establish a SARM, enobosarm, as the first drug for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimizing quality of life (QoL) remains the central tenet of care in patients with incurable cancer; however, determinants of QoL are not clear. The objective of the current study was to examine which factors influence QoL in patients with incurable cancer., METHODS: A multicenter study of adult patients with advanced cancer was conducted in Ireland and the United Kingdom between 2011 and 2016. Data were collected from patients at study entry and included patient demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), nutritional parameters (the percentage weight loss [%WL]), muscle parameters assessed using computed tomography images (skeletal muscle index and skeletal muscle attenuation), inflammatory markers (modified Glasgow Prognostic score [mGPS]), and QoL data (the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30). The relation between clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory parameters with QoL was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and multivariate binary logistic regression. Components of the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30 (physical function, fatigue, and appetite loss) and summary QoL scores were mean-dichotomized for the logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Data were available for 1027 patients (51% men; median age, 66 years). Gastrointestinal cancer was most prevalent (40%), followed by lung cancer (26%) and breast cancer (9%). Distant metastatic disease was present in 87% of patients. The %WL, ECOG-PS, and mGPS were significantly correlated with deteriorating QoL functional and symptom scales (all P < .001). On multivariate regression analysis, >10% WL (odds ratio [OR], 2.69; 95% CI, 1.63-4.42), an ECOG-PS of 3 or 4 (OR, 14.33; 95% CI, 6.76-30.37), and an mGPS of 2 (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.29) were independently associated with poorer summary QoL scores. These parameters were also independently associated with poorer physical function, fatigue, and appetite loss (all P < .05). Low skeletal muscle attenuation was independently associated with poorer physical functioning (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09-2.56), but muscle parameters were not independently associated with fatigue, appetite loss, or QoL summary scores., CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicate that QoL is determined (at least in part) by WL, ECOG-PS, and the systemic inflammatory response in patients with advanced cancer. Identifying early predictors of poor QoL may allow the identification of patients who may benefit from early referral to palliative and supportive care, which has been shown to improve QoL.

AB  - Pancoast syndrome remains a rare presentation of pulmonary diseases. Even in endemic area of echinococcosis, lung's hydatid cyst is seldomly revealed by this syndrome. We report a case of a 38 year old male patient who presented to our department with neck and left superior limb pain associated with palmar muscle atrophy and Horner's syndrome. Radiological investigations suggested the diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the left lung apex which was confirmed by surgical excision and pathological examination of the lesion. This case highlights an uncommon etiology of Pancoast syndrome which might mislead physicians in their practice.

AB  - The symptom burden of patients with lung cancer is extensive and includes loss of appetite, dyspnea, and other symptoms that lead to decreased quality of life. Randomized controlled trial data indicate that early palliative care improves quality of life and depressive symptoms and may extend survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer compared with standard care. Combining an appetite stimulant (megestrol acetate) with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) leads to greater weight gain and appetite improvement compared with an appetite stimulant alone. Cancer-related dyspnea appears to be a "central" effect that stems from altered afferent inputs in the setting of ventilatory muscle weakness; various treatment options that have shown success in treating cancer-related dyspnea are opioids, tunneled pleural catheters, bilevel positive airway pressure, and nebulized furosemide. Buprenorphine is a unique opioid with activity at mu and nociceptin receptors (also called opioid-receptor-like receptors); it improves pain states dominated by central sensitization.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome that may reveal a primitive tumor. Neuroblastoma in children and small cell lung carcinoma in adults are the leading tumors revealed or expressed by paraneoplastic phenomena. The clinical neurologic manifestations of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are muscular weakness, sleepiness, absence of reflexes, and dysautonomia. Neurologic manifestations are explained by the induction of an autoimmune response because of the presence of antigens that are expressed by the tumor. Neurologic paraneoplastic disorders may also be the result of toxicity of drugs, coagulopathy, infection, or metabolic diseases. We describe the case of a 13-month-old child with unusual neurologic symptoms because of the presence of an abdominal neuroblastoma.

AB  - Programmed death receptor 1 (PD1) checkpoint inhibitors are known for immune mediated toxicities such as colitis, endocrinopathies and pneumonitis. However, other rare adverse effects are reported in the literature. Nivolumab is an anti-PD1 immunotherapy used in the second line of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report two cases of rare toxicities occurring under nivolumab in patients without a history of dysimmunity. A 79-year-old patient with a large-cell carcinoma showed a muscle weakness after the second course, revealing myositis with a CPK grade IV elevation as well as symptoms of myasthenia. The diagnosis of myositis was confirmed by a muscle biopsy. An 82-year-old patient followed for bronchial adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation, presented with nivolumab shoulder and hip pain with extreme fatigue. After further investigations, the diagnosis of systemic erythematosus lupus was retained. Investigations led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. For both patients treatment was interrupted and systemic corticosteroid therapy was initiated permitting resolution of symptoms. The occurrence of symptoms of dysimmunity should attract the attention of the clinician, leading to discontinuation of anti-PD1 therapy and corticosteroid therapy. Retreatment after symptoms resolution must be collegially discussed if no alternative therapeutic is available. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle depletion negatively impacts treatment efficacy and survival rates in cancer. Prevention and timely treatment of muscle loss require prediction of patients at risk. We aimed to investigate the potential of skeletal muscle radiomic features to predict future muscle loss., METHODS: A total of 116 patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer included in a randomised controlled trial (NCT01171170) studying the effect of nitroglycerin added to paclitaxel-carboplatin-bevacizumab were enrolled. In this post hoc analysis, muscle cross-sectional area and radiomic features were extracted from computed tomography images obtained before initiation of chemotherapy and shortly after administration of the second cycle. For internal cross-validation, the cohort was randomly split in a training set and validation set 100 times. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method to select features that were most significantly associated with muscle loss and an area under the curve (AUC) for model performance., RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (59%) exhibited loss of skeletal muscle. One hundred ninety-three features were used to construct a prediction model for muscle loss. The average AUC was 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36, 0.62). Differences in intensity and texture radiomic features over time were seen between patients with and without muscle loss., CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that skeletal muscle radiomics did not predict future muscle loss during chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Differences in radiomic features over time might reflect myosteatosis. Future imaging analysis combined with muscle tissue analysis in patients and in experimental models is needed to unravel the biological processes linked to the radiomic features.

AB  - Results of epidemiological studies have shown that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequently associated with comorbidities, the most serious and prevalent being cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and cachexia. Mechanistically, environmental risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diet, exacerbations, and physical inactivity or inherent factors such as genetic background and ageing contribute to this association. No convincing evidence has been provided to suggest that treatment of COPD would reduce comorbidities, although some indirect indications are available. Clear evidence that treatment of comorbidities improves COPD is also lacking, although observational studies would suggest such an effect for statins, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blockers and receptor antagonists. Large-scale prospective studies are needed. Reduction of common risk factors seems to be the most powerful approach to reduce comorbidities. Whether reduction of so-called spill-over of local inflammation from the lungs or systemic inflammation with inhaled or systemic anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively, would also reduce COPD-related comorbidities is doubtful.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between early changes in muscle and adipose tissue during chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the first line NVALT12 trial (NCT01171170) in stage IV NSCLC, skeletal muscle (SM), radiation attenuation (RA), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were assessed at the third lumbar level on CT-images obtained before initiation of chemotherapy and shortly after administration of the second cycle. The contribution of changes in different body compartments to overall survival was assessed., RESULTS: CT scans of 111 patients were included. Analysis of body composition changes between the baseline and the follow-up scan, revealed that overall SM cross sectional area (CSA), radiation attenuation and SAT CSA decreased respectively by -1.2 +/- 2.9 cm2/m2 (p < 0.001), -0.7 +/- 3.3 HU (p = 0.026) and -1.9 +/- 8.7 cm2/m2 (p = 0.026), while no significant changes in VAT tissue were observed. Longitudinally, median OS was significantly shorter among patients losing SM compared to patients with preserved SM (9.4 versus 14.2 months; HR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.79, p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses showed that proportional loss of muscle mass was associated with poor OS (HR 0.949, 95% CI: 0.915, 0.985, p = 0.006) independent from important clinical prognostic factors including WHO-PS, gender, age and Charlson comorbidity index., CONCLUSION: Early loss of SM during first line chemotherapy is a poor prognostic factor in stage IV NSCLC patients. Future studies have to reveal whether early supportive intervention guided by initial CT muscle response to chemotherapy can influence the wasting process and related mortality risk.

AB  - Muscle wasting in experimental cancer cachexia has been associated with increased ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic system activity and increased uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. Increased ubiquitin proteasome pathway activity has also been found in gastric, but not lung, cancer patients. It therefore remains unclear in which patients modulation of this proteolytic system could be a therapeutic target. We investigated markers of systemic inflammation, hypermetabolism and expression of ubiquitin and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 in muscle of pancreatic cancer patients. Rectus abdominis muscle was sampled from 15 weight-losing pancreatic cancer patients and 11 controls. UCP2 and 3, and ubiquitin mRNA expression were measured by Northern blots and UCP3 protein by Western blotting. Resting energy expenditure and plasma IL-6, sTNF-R and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured. Cancer patients had lost 18% of pre-illness stable weight, but were not significantly hypermetabolic compared with controls. IL-6, sTNF-R and CRP levels and ubiquitin 2.4 kb, but not 1.2 kb, mRNA expression were increased in cancer patients. UCP-2 and 3 mRNA and UCP-3 protein were similar in both groups. Weight loss correlated with systemic inflammation and ubiquitin 1.2 and 2.4 kb mRNA expression. Weight loss in pancreatic cancer is associated with systemic inflammation and increased mRNA expression for ubiquitin but not uncoupling proteins in skeletal muscle. The pro-inflammatory network and ubiquitin proteasome pathway may be targets for intervention in pancreatic cancer cachexia.

AB  - Sarcopenia and cachexia are muscle-wasting syndromes associated with aging and with many chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure. While mechanisms are complex, these conditions are often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). We found that Ang II infusion in rodents leads to skeletal muscle wasting via alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, increased apoptosis, enhanced muscle protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and decreased appetite resulting from downregulation of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides orexin and neuropeptide Y. Furthermore, Ang II inhibits skeletal muscle stem cell proliferation, leading to lowered muscle regenerative capacity. Distinct stem cell Ang II receptor subtypes are critical for regulation of muscle regeneration. In ischemic mouse congestive heart failure model skeletal muscle wasting and attenuated muscle regeneration are Ang II dependent. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in mechanisms underlying cachexia in chronic disease states.

AB  - Background: Gastric carcinoma (GC) patients usually present with locally advanced or metastatic disease; therefore treatment aim is mainly palliation. In this study our purpose is to analyze the prognostic values of the sarcopenia index (SI), cachexia index (CIn) and other inflammatory indexes (advanced lung cancer inflammation index [ALI], modified Glasgow Prognostic Score [mGPS], prognostic index [PI], prognostic nutritional index [PNI] and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR]) in metastatic GC patients. Methods: Data from the files of metastatic GC patients, who applied to Medical Oncology outpatient clinic in Marmara University Pendik Education and Research Hospital between January 2011 and June 2016, were retrospectively reviewed. Five hundred seventy patients with gastric cancer were detected. Exclusion criteria were the inability to reach the patient surveys for prognostic index calculations, the presence of additional comorbidities to affect the laboratory parameters, and the absence of metastatic disease. Finally, 87 of these patients were included in this study. For SI calculation L3 level muscle area was measured from patients' computed tomography (CT) by a radiologist. SI reference value was obtained from western-EGWSOP (The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People) and eastern (Harada Y, et al.) sources separately, as Turkey doesn't have a reference value for SI. NLR cutoff value was accepted as the median value of patients' NLR measurements. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess independent prognostic factors. The area under the curve was used to compare the prognostic value of indexes. Results: The median length of follow-up of 87 patients was nine months (1-64 mo,/s), and 78 patients died during follow-up. Fifty-nine patients were male (63%), and the median age was 62 (range, 23-88). According to univariate analysis high mGPS and PI score, PNI level <45, NLR level >= 3.41, ALI level <18, CI level under 35, SI (Harada Y, et al) <=44.5 for males and <=36.5 for females, ECOG score >= 2, weight loss more than 10% during last 6 mo, BMI under 24 were poor prognostic factors. Age, gender, having multiple organ metastasis, history of gastric surgery, positivity C-erb-B2, SI (EGWSOP) <=52.4 for males, and <=38.4 for females did not have any impact on survival. According to multivariate analysis, high mGPS (score 2) (HR 2,494, 95% CI 1.25-4 .94, p = 0.02), PNI (score 1) (HR 4.2, 95% CI 1.73-10.1, p < 0.001) and ECOG score (>=2) (HR 1.541, 95% CI 1,089-4,214, p = 0.004) have been found to be independent prognostic factors which are determining the survival. mGPS was found to be more valuable than other indexes for predicting mortality by measuring the AUC with ROC analysis. Conclusions: In our study, mGPS, PNI and ECOG score were independent indicators for shorter survival in metastatic gastric cancer patients. mGPS and PNI, which can be done by using only serum CRP, albumin level and complete blood count, might be inexpensive, practical and beneficial to use in routine clinical practice to determine survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether sarcopenia has any impact on long-term survival of patients with surgically treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on current topic comprehensively for the first time., METHODS: We systematically searched relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to July 3, 2018. Data of 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates as well as hazard ratio (HR) of OS were collected for analysis by using the STATA 12.0 package., RESULTS: A total of 6 cohort studies consisting of 1213 patients (422 patients with sarcopenia and 791 patients without) were included for analysis. Meta-analysis showed that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly lower 5-year OS rate (risk ratio (RR)=1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI)=[1.13, 2.33]; P=0.008) than those without, which was more prominent in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Sarcopenia was found to be an independent predictor of poor OS in patients with surgically treated NSCLC (HR=2.85; 95%CI=[1.67, 4.86]; P<0.001). With a limited sample size, there was no sufficient evidence of significantly different 5-year DFS rate between the two groups (RR=1.14; 95%CI=[0.59, 2.17]; P=0.70). However, in the subgroup of patients with early-stage NSCLC, sarcopenia was associated with a significantly lower 5-year DFS rate (RR=1.59; 95%CI=[1.01, 2.52]; P=0.046)., CONCLUSION: Patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse prognosis than those without after surgical resection of NSCLC especially in those at early stage. Sarcopenia is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with surgically treated NSCLC. (246 words).

AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'Does sarcopenia have any impact on survival of patients with surgically treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?'. Altogether, 342 papers were found using the reported search, of which 9 cohort studies represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Eight of the studies measured skeletal muscle or total psoas cross-sectional area at the level of the first or third lumbar vertebra normalized for the square of height for defining sarcopenia, while 1 study used absolute measurement of total psoas cross-sectional area. Seven of 8 studies looking at overall survival found that patients with sarcopenia had significantly worse overall survival than those without after surgical resection of NSCLC, while 1 failed to show a difference. Five studies reported disease-free survival, with 3 studies showing no difference and 2 showing that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse disease-free survival than those without. One study found that sarcopenia was a predictor of early recurrence in NSCLC patient after surgical resection. Therefore, we conclude that sarcopenia could serve as a predictor of poor prognosis of patients with surgically treated NSCLC. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by an ongoing loss of body weight, mainly due to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle wasting. Muscle atrophy leads to a progressive functional impairment and contributes to a negative impact on patient's quality of life. Oxidative Stress (OS) seems to play a major role in muscle atrophy since OS markers are increased in plasma and muscles of cancer patients. Thus, supplementing patients with antioxidant may reduce OS and restore muscle mass and function. In this study, we assess the effects of antioxidant supplementation on muscle atrophy in a model of colon 26 tumor-bearing mice (C26-mice). Five-week old Balb/c mice receive a subcutaneous injection of PBS or C26 cancer cells with or without daily supplementation with Allopurinol or Oxynov (50mg/kg and 163mg/kg respectively). Blood and muscles are removed 20-22 days after injection. C26-mice develop cachexia, with a decrease in total body weight, muscular endurance and muscle fibers diameter. Furthermore, injection of C26 induces ubiquitination of muscles proteins, suggesting the enhancement of muscle proteolysis. Contrary to our expectations, supplementation with antioxidants (Allopurinol or Oxynov) doesn't prevent weight loss and muscle atrophy but induces premature death of mice. C26-mice exhibit systemic oxidative stress markers (i.e. carbonyl proteins and 4-HNE) and show an increase in phosphorylation levels of the redox-dependent kinase, JNK, in the atrophied muscles (i.e. gastrocnemius). Surprisingly, Allopurinol or Oxynov decrease the total antioxidant defenses in plasma but has no effect on C26-induced oxidative damages and JNK phosphorylation. Our results are in agreement with recent reports showing deleterious effects of antioxidants supplementation in lung and prostate cancer. However, such findings require further investigations.

AB  - Preserving muscle is not only crucial for maintaining proper physical movement, but also for its many metabolic and homeostatic roles. Low muscle mass has been shown to adversely affect health outcomes in a variety of disease states (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease) and leads to an increased risk for readmission and mortality in hospitalized patients. Low muscle mass is now included in the most recent diagnostic criteria for malnutrition. Current management strategies for malnutrition may not prioritize the maintenance and restoration of muscle mass. This likely reflects the challenge of identifying and measuring this body composition compartment in clinical practice and the lack of awareness by health care professionals of the importance that muscle plays in patient health outcomes. As such, we provide a review of current approaches and make recommendations for managing low muscle mass and preventing muscle loss in clinical practice. Recommendations to assist the clinician in the optimal management of patients at risk of low muscle mass include the following: (1) place muscle mass at the core of nutritional assessment and management strategies; (2) identify and assess low muscle mass; (3) develop a management pathway for patients at risk of low muscle mass; (4) optimize nutrition to focus on muscle mass gain versus weight gain alone; and (5) promote exercise and/or rehabilitation therapy to help maintain and build muscle mass. The need to raise awareness of the importance of screening and managing 'at risk' patients so it becomes routine is imperative for change to occur. Health systems need to drive clinicians to treat patients with this focused approach, and the economic benefits need to be communicated to payers. Lastly, further focused research in the area of managing patients with low muscle mass is warranted. Copyright © 2018 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

AB  - The majority of cancer patients experience some form of body composition change during the disease trajectory. For example, breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy gain fat and lose skeletal muscle, which are associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence and clinical comorbidities. In contrast, advanced cancer patients, such as lung and colorectal cancer patients, experience symptoms of cancer cachexia (accelerated loss of skeletal muscle with or without adipose tissue loss), which are associated with decreased treatment response and poorer survival rates in advanced cancers. The heterogeneity of body composition features and their diverse implications across different cancer populations supports the need for accurate quantification of muscle and adipose tissue. Use of appropriate body composition modalities will facilitate an understanding of the complex relationship between body composition characteristics and clinical outcomes. This will ultimately support the development and evaluation of future therapeutic interventions that aim to counter muscle loss and fat gain in cancer populations. Despite the various metabolic complications that may confound the accurate body composition measurement in cancer patients (i.e., dehydration may confound lean tissue measurement), there are no guidelines for selecting the most appropriate modalities to make these measurements. In this review we outline specific considerations for choosing the most optimal approaches of lean and adipose tissue measurements among different cancer populations. Anthropometric measures, bioelectrical impedance analysis, air displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging will be discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Low skeletal muscle mass has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with advanced lung cancer. However, little is known about the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and overall survival in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of low trunk muscle mass in predicting overall survival in these patients., METHODS: The data from 198 patients who were diagnosed with bone metastases from lung cancer from April 2009 to May 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The areas of the psoas and paravertebral muscles were measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on computed tomography scans taken at the time nearest to the diagnosis of bone metastasis. Muscle area was evaluated for male and female cohorts separately using different cutoff points. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the factors independently associated with overall survival., RESULTS: The overall survival of patients in the lowest quartile for psoas muscle area or paravertebral muscle area was significantly shorter than that of patients above the 25th percentile for muscle area (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that paravertebral muscle mass (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.56; p = 0.006), epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy, and performance status were independent prognostic factors., CONCLUSIONS: Low paravertebral muscle mass was associated with shorter survival, independently of known prognostic factors.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome (EAS) is often caused by neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of lungs, pancreas, thymus, and other less frequent locations. Localizing the source of ACTH can be challenging. A 64-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing fatigue, muscular weakness, and dyspnea. He was in poor condition and showed facial redness, proximal amyotrophy, and bruises. Laboratory disclosed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and markedly elevated ACTH and cortisol levels. Pituitary was normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling with corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation showed no significant central-to-periphery gradient of ACTH. Head and neck, thoracic and abdominal computerized tomography (CT), MRI, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SSRS), and (18)F-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) failed to identify the primary tumor. (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA)-PET/CT unveiled a 20-mm nodule in the jejunum and a metastatic lymph node. Segmental jejunum resection showed two adjacent NETs, measuring 2.0 and 0.5 cm with a peritoneal metastasis. The largest tumor expressed ACTH in 30% of cells. Following surgery, after a transient adrenal insufficiency, ACTH and cortisol levels returned to normal values and remain normal over a follow-up of 26 months. Small mid-gut NETs are difficult to localize on CT or MRI, and require metabolic imaging. Owing to low mitotic activity, NETs are generally poor candidates for FDG-PET, whereas SSRS shows poor sensitivity in EAS due to intrinsically low tumor concentration of type-2 somatostatin receptors (SST2) or to receptor down regulation by excess cortisol. However, F-DOPA-PET, which is related to amine precursor uptake by NETs, has been reported to have high positive predictive value for occult EAS despite low sensitivity, and constitutes a useful alternative to more conventional methods of tumor localization., LEARNING POINTS: Uncontrolled high cortisol levels in EAS can be lethal if untreated.Surgical excision is the keystone of NETs treatment, thus tumor localization is crucial.Most cases of EAS are caused by NETs, which are located mainly in the lungs. However, small gut NETs are elusive to conventional imaging and require metabolic imaging for detection.FDG-PET, based on tumor high metabolic rate, may not detect NETs that have low mitotic activity. SSRS may also fail, due to absent or low concentration of SST2, which may be down regulated by excess cortisol.F-DOPA-PET, based on amine-precursor uptake, can be a useful method to localize the occult source of ACTH in EAS when other methods have failed.

AB  - Optimal management of dyspnea in terminal cancer patients requires an understanding of the responsible pathophysiological mechanisms. This prospective study assessed visual analogue scales (VAS) of shortness of breath (SOB) and anxiety, bedside spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), chest radiography, arterial blood gases, hemoglobin, and electrocardiogram, if indicated, in 100 terminally ill cancer patients. Forty-nine percent of the patients had lung cancer. The median VAS scores for SOB and anxiety were 53 mm and 29 mm, respectively. Spirometry was abnormal in 93% of patients, with 5% having obstructive, 41% restrictive, and 47% mixed patterns. The median MIP was 16 cm H2O. Sixty-five percent of the patients had parenchymal or pleural involvement on chest radiograph. Twenty-nine percent had evidence of cardiac ischemia, recent or current myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. Patients had a median of five different abnormalities that could have contributed to their shortness of breath. Only anxiety (p = 0.001), a history of smoking (p = 0.02), and pCO2 levels were statistically significantly correlated with SOB VAS scores. The potentially correctable causes of dyspnea included hypoxia (40%), anemia (20%), and bronchospasm (52%). The finding of very low MIPs suggests severe respiratory muscle weakness may contribute significantly to dyspnea in this patient population. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and characterize the underlying pathophysiology.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by progressive, symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness with accompanying compatible cutaneous findings. Thirty-nine patients with dermatomyositis from the Louisville, Kentucky area were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped into those with or without a malignancy. Ten patients (26%) either had or have had a malignancy. Twenty-five Caucasian patients were HLA typed for the A, B, DR and DQ locus antigens, of whom 5 had an associated malignancy and 20 did not have a malignancy. We found that no single antigen had a significantly increased or decreased frequency as compared with our control population for the entire group, or for any clinical subset we examined. Serologic testing revealed 4 patients with anti-Mi-2 antibodies and 1 patient with anti-PM-SCL antibodies. No patient had a positive anti-Jo-1 antibody in this group. The results of serologic tests in this group did not correlate with any clinical subset or HLA antigen. Our findings were in agreement with the previous reports in which approximately 25% of patients with DM have an associated malignancy. Our findings also support the notion that untargeted malignancy searches are not warranted. Contrary to previous reports we did not observe an inverse relationship between cancer and pulmonary disease in the dermatomyositis patient. This study does not indicate that there are any HLA associations or clinical associations, other than age, that distinguish patients with dermatomyositis as running a greater risk of developing malignancy.

AB  - This article presents the case of a 62-year-old patient with cancer in the left upper pulmonary lobe who underwent lobe resection with postoperative respiratory insufficiency. The right upper lobe had already been resected 5 years earlier because of an adenocarcinoma. Prior to the present surgery a computed tomography scan detected a narrow stenosis at the former resection site; however, both pulmonary lobes beyond this stenosis appeared to be sufficiently ventilated. After resection of the left upper lobe attempted extubation was unsuccessful due to insufficient global gas exchange as the stenosis prevented ventilation of the right lung. Bronchoscopy provided evidence of a normal diameter of the bronchus behind the stenosis so both lobes were to be recruited after possible correction of this section. A veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation device (ECMO) was established as bridging therapy to attain normal gas exchange. As the patient showed no muscle weakness and was cooperative, extubation was performed and spontaneous breathing occurred without any support while still under ECMO treatment. The stenosis was reduced by bronchoscopic laser resection within seven consecutive sessions. Each of these surgeries was conducted with the patient under general anesthesia with oral intubation and jet ventilation in combination with the ECMO. The patient was extubated after each treatment session and weaned from ECMO after the final resection within 2 days. This case demonstrates the use of ECMO in combination with surgical procedures in a spontaneously breathing patient as a causal therapy and option for selected patients to prevent complications from long-term ventilation.

AB  - Ectopic ACTH secretion due to malignant tumours is the most frequently underdiagnosed form of Cushing's syndrome. The majority of neoplasms causing ectopic ACTH syndrome are small-cell cancers of the lung or carcinoids. Other well-documented cases include adenocarcinoma of the lung, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pancreatic islet tumours and malignant thymoma. We report a rare case of metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma with ectopic ACTH syndrome. Clinical features such as proximal muscle weakness, peripheral oedema, hypertension or hirsutism in women, or the presence of unexplained hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia or metabolic alkalosis in patients with known malignancy strongly suggest ectopic ACTH syndrome. Removal of the source of ACTH is the treatment of first choice, but often not feasible. Most often, treatment modalities are only palliative, with drugs directed against hypercortisolism such as aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, ketoconazole or mifepristone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antitumor activity and safety profile of plitidepsin administered as a 1h weekly intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 3.2mg/m(2) to patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who relapsed or progressed after one line of chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, exploratory, phase II clinical trial. Treatment lasted until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or treatment delay for >2 weeks. Objective response rate (primary efficacy endpoint) was evaluated according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). The rate of stable disease (SD) lasting for at least 6 months and time-to-event variables were secondary endpoints of efficacy. Toxicity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 2.0., RESULTS: Twenty pretreated SCLC patients (median age, 60 years) with extensive (n = 13) or limited-stage disease (n = 7) received a total of 24 treatment cycles (median, one cycle per patient; range, 1-2). Objective tumor responses were not observed and only one of the 17 evaluable patients had SD. With a median follow-up of 11.8 months, the progression-free survival and the median overall survival were 1.3 months and 4.8 months, respectively. The most troubling or common toxicities were fatigue, muscle weakness, lymphopenia, anemia (no patients showed neutropenia), and asymptomatic, non-cumulative increase of transaminases levels and alkaline phosphatase., CONCLUSION: This clinical trial shows that a cycle of 1h weekly i.v. infusion of plitidepsin (3.2mg/m(2)) was generally well tolerated other than fatigue and muscle weakness in patients with pretreated SCLC. One patient died due to multi-organ failure. The absence of antitumor activity found here precludes further studies of this plitidepsin schedule as second-line single-agent treatment of SCLC.

AB  - Rates of synthesis of protein were measured in vivo in skeletal muscle and in the whole body of cachectic patients with cancer and in normal healthy men, using a tracer infusion of leucine labelled with a stable isotope. Synthesis of protein in muscle was significantly reduced in the patients with cancer (0.030 v 0.198%/hour; p less than 0.01), whereas whole body rates of protein synthesis and degradation did not differ significantly between the two groups. Thus depression of synthesis of protein in muscle appeared to be the immediate cause of muscle wasting in cancerous cachexia. Any therapeutic intervention that aims at preventing the onset of cachexia should be designed to stimulate the synthesis of protein in muscle, and measurement of turnover of protein may be used to evaluate such treatment provided that rates of protein synthesis are measured directly in specific tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional nutritional supplements are not or only partly successful in inducing protein accretion in advanced cancer, suggesting an attenuated anabolic response. To prevent muscle wasting and its deleterious consequences, generating an anabolic response is crucial. Dietary essential amino acids (EAA) have anabolic properties in other wasting diseases; however, data in advanced cancer are lacking., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 13 patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage III and IV) and 11 healthy age-matched subjects, we measured protein synthesis and breakdown of the whole body, and net protein anabolism (difference between protein synthesis and breakdown) after intake of 14 g of free EAA with high leucine levels (EAA/leucine) versus a balanced amino acid mixture containing both EAA and non-EAA as present in whey protein, according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design., RESULTS: Protein synthesis and net protein anabolism were higher after intake of the EAA/leucine than the balanced amino acid mixture (P < 0.001), independent of presence of cancer. A highly significant linear relationship between net protein anabolism and the amount of EAA available in the systemic circulation (R(2): 0.85, P < 0.001) was found in both groups. The presence of muscle or recent weight loss, systemic inflammatory response, or length of survival did not influence this relationship. High leucine levels in the EAA/leucine mixture was of no anabolic benefit., CONCLUSIONS: There is no anabolic resistance or attenuated anabolic potential to intake of 14 g of EAA/leucine or balanced amino acid mixture in advanced (mainly stage III) NSCLC. The high anabolic potential of dietary EAA in cancer patients is independent of their nutritional status, systemic inflammatory response or disease trajectory, suggesting a key role of EAA in new nutritional approaches to prevent muscle loss, thereby improving outcome of patients with advanced cancer., CLINICALTRAILSGOV: NCT01172314.

AB  - The radiological assessment of muscle properties-size, mass, density (also termed radiodensity), composition, and adipose tissue infiltration-is fundamental in muscle diseases. More recently, it also became obvious that muscle atrophy, also termed muscle wasting, is caused by or associated with many other diseases or conditions, such as inactivity, malnutrition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cancer-associated cachexia, diabetes, renal and cardiac failure, and sarcopenia and even potentially with osteoporotic hip fracture. Several techniques have been developed to quantify muscle morphology and function. This review is dedicated to quantitative computed tomography (CT) of skeletal muscle and only includes a brief comparison with magnetic resonance imaging. Strengths and limitations of CT techniques are discussed in detail, including CT scanner calibration, acquisition and reconstruction protocols, and the various quantitative parameters that can be measured with CT, starting from simple volume measures to advanced parameters describing the adipose tissue distribution within muscle. Finally, the use of CT in sarcopenia and cachexia and the relevance of muscle parameters for the assessment of osteoporotic fracture illustrate the application of CT in two emerging areas of medical interest.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy associated with characteristic skin manifestations. In 15-20% of patients present with dysphagia, it is associated with nutritional deficiency, predisposition to aspiration pneumonia, decreased quality of life and a poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized association between DM and malignancies, including ovarian, breast, lung, and colon cancer. We report a case of a male patient aged 85 with DM associated with colon adenocarcinoma; progressive dysphagia was the first manifestation, and subsequently proximal muscle weakness and typical skin lesions were present. Given the clinical suspicion of DM as a paraneoplastic syndrome, tumor markers were order and a high carcinoembryonic antigen was found. A colonoscopy study and histopathologic examination revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma of the colon.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is often an effective tool for the treatment of brain metastases. A complication of radiosurgical treatment for brain metastasis can be persistent cerebral edema. Treatments of this refractory cerebral edema include observation, corticosteroids, and surgical resection of the edema-inducing mass. Laser-interstitial thermal therapy is a minimally invasive technique for ablating intracranial lesions. It may provide a treatment option for metastases after radiosurgery causing refractory cerebral edema., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 64-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma presenting to our department with left hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an 18-mm enhancing lesion in the right external capsule with significant surrounding edema. The lesion was treated by radiosurgery. There was persistent edema after radiosurgery. The patient required continued corticosteroid therapy to maintain his ability to ambulate. He developed refractory hyperglycemia, weight gain, and bilateral proximal muscle weakness secondary to this therapy. Fourteen weeks after radiosurgery, he underwent laser-interstitial thermal therapy for lesion ablation. He was weaned off corticosteroids during 2 weeks and maintained his strength during the following month., CONCLUSIONS: Laser-interstitial thermal therapy may be a treatment option for refractory cerebral edema after stereotactic radiosurgery to a metastasis. This therapy may be of particular use in deep-seated lesions refractory to corticosteroid therapy. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, visceral fat volume, and bone density have been associated with lung cancer survival. We developed a morphomic index based on computed tomographic measurements of these components, and assessed its relationship to survival after lung cancer resection., METHODS: Patients who underwent lung cancer resection from 1995 to 2014 were evaluated. A morphomic index (range of 0 to 3) was developed as the sum of the scores for three body components-dorsal muscle area, vertebral trabecular bone density, and visceral fat area-measured at vertebral levels T10 to T12, with a point assigned to each component when in the lowest tercile. The relationship of the morphomic index to overall survival was assessed by the log rank test. Overall survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for relevant covariates., RESULTS: We included 944 patients (451 women; 48%). The mean age was 66.4 +/- 10.3 years. Median follow-up was 4.5 years. Median survival was associated with the morphomic index scores on univariate analysis (P < .001). Morphomic index scores of 2 (P = .026) and 3 (P = .004) referenced to score 0 or 1 were independent predictors of survival on Cox regression analysis., CONCLUSIONS: A morphomic index is an independent predictor of survival after lung cancer resection. The index may help in calibrating patient expectations and in shared decision making regarding lung cancer surgery. Copyright © 2020 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? We explored whether experimental cancer-induced cachexia may alter mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes and oxygen uptake in respiratory and peripheral muscles,and whether signalling pathways, proteasome and oxidative stress influence that process. What is the main finding and what is its importance? In cancer cachectic mice, MRC complexes and oxygen consumption were decreased in the diaphragm and gastrocnemius. Blockade of nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase actions partly restored the muscle mass and force and corrected the MRC dysfunction,while concomitantly reducing tumour burden. Antioxidants improved mitochondrial oxygen consumption without eliciting effects on the loss of muscle mass and force or the tumour size,whereas bortezomib reduced tumour burden without influencing muscle mass and strength or MRC function. Abnormalities in mitochondrial content, morphology and function have been reported in several muscle-wasting conditions. We specifically explored whether experimental cancer-induced cachexia may alter mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes and oxygen uptake in respiratory and peripheral muscles, and whether signalling pathways, proteasomes and oxidative stress may influence that process. We evaluated complex I, II and IV enzyme activities (specific activity assays) and MRC oxygen consumption (polarographic measurements) in diaphragm and gastrocnemius of cachectic mice bearing the LP07 lung tumour, with and without treatment with N-acetylcysteine, bortezomib and nuclear factor-kappaB (sulfasalazine) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK, U0126) inhibitors (n = 10 per group for all groups). Whole-body and muscle weights and limb muscle force were also assessed in all rodents at baseline and after 1 month. Compared with control animals, cancer cachectic mice showed a significant reduction in body weight gain, smaller sizes of the diaphragm and gastrocnemius, lower muscle strength, decreased activity of complexes I, II and IV and decreased oxygen consumption in both muscles. Blockade of nuclear factor-kappaB and MAPK actions restored muscle mass and force and corrected the MRC dysfunction in both muscles, while partly reducing tumour burden. Antioxidants improved mitochondrial oxygen uptake without eliciting significant effects on the loss of muscle mass and force or tumour size, whereas the proteasome inhibitor reduced tumour burden without significantly influencing muscle mass and strength or mitochondrial function. In conclusion, nuclear factor-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways modulate muscle mass and performance and MRC function of respiratory and limb muscles in this model of experimental cancer cachexia, thus offering targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is a metabolic syndrome with alterations in gene regulatory networks that consequently lead to skeletal muscle wasting. Integrating microRNAs-mRNAs omics profiles offers an opportunity to understand transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks underlying muscle wasting. Here, we used RNA sequencing to simultaneously integrate and explore microRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) model of cancer cachexia. We found 1,008 mRNAs and 18 microRNAs differentially expressed in cachectic mice compared with controls. Although our transcriptomic analysis demonstrated a high heterogeneity in mRNA profiles of cachectic mice, we identified a reduced number of differentially expressed genes that were uniformly regulated within cachectic muscles. This set of uniformly regulated genes is associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM), proteolysis, and inflammatory response. We also used transcriptomic data to perform enrichment analysis of transcriptional factor binding sites in promoter sequences, which revealed activation of the atrophy-related transcription factors NF-kappaB, Stat3, AP-1, and FoxO. Furthermore, the integration of mRNA and microRNA expression profiles identified post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs of genes involved in ECM organization, cell migration, transcription factors binding, ion transport, and the FoxO signaling pathway. Our integrative analysis of microRNA-mRNA co-profiles comprehensively characterized regulatory relationships of molecular pathways and revealed microRNAs targeting ECM-associated genes in cancer cachexia.

AB  - Geroscience, the new interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the relationship between aging and chronic age-related diseases (ARDs) and geriatric syndromes (GSs), is based on epidemiological evidence and experimental data that aging is the major risk factor for such pathologies and assumes that aging and ARDs/GSs share a common set of basic biological mechanisms. A consequence is that the primary target of medicine is to combat aging instead of any single ARD/GSs one by one, as favored by the fragmentation into hundreds of specialties and sub-specialties. If the same molecular and cellular mechanisms underpin both aging and ARDs/GSs, a major question emerges: which is the difference, if any, between aging and ARDs/GSs? The hypothesis that ARDs and GSs such as frailty can be conceptualized as accelerated aging will be discussed by analyzing in particular frailty, sarcopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson as well as Down syndrome as an example of progeroid syndrome. According to this integrated view, aging and ARDs/GSs become part of a continuum where precise boundaries do not exist and the two extremes are represented by centenarians, who largely avoided or postponed most ARDs/GSs and are characterized by decelerated aging, and patients who suffered one or more severe ARDs in their 60s, 70s, and 80s and show signs of accelerated aging, respectively. In between these two extremes, there is a continuum of intermediate trajectories representing a sort of gray area. Thus, clinically different, classical ARDs/GSs are, indeed, the result of peculiar combinations of alterations regarding the same, limited set of basic mechanisms shared with the aging process. Whether an individual will follow a trajectory of accelerated or decelerated aging will depend on his/her genetic background interacting lifelong with environmental and lifestyle factors. If ARDs and GSs are manifestations of accelerated aging, it is urgent to identify markers capable of distinguishing between biological and chronological age to identify subjects at higher risk of developing ARDs and GSs. To this aim, we propose the use of DNA methylation, N-glycans profiling, and gut microbiota composition to complement the available disease-specific markers.

AB  - A 37-years old patient of south Indian origin presented with pain in his right scapular region radiating to the right arm, numbness and muscular weakness of the fourth and fifth finger. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass at the right pleural dome with arrosion of the first rib (Pancoast presentation), an osteolytic process in the fourth rib and in the right hip. All three lesions had a high FDG uptake in the PET/CT suggestive for lung cancer metastases in this smoker. Surprisingly, the CT-guided fine needle biopsy revealed no malignancy, but granulomatous inflammation and epitheloid cells. Microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was negative, but the culture was positive for AFB. The HIV-negative patient received a regular antituberculous chemotherapy. His condition as well as the radiological findings improved gradually. In the majority of cases, space occupying masses in the upper sulcus are caused by non-small cell lung cancers. Extrapulmonal tuberculosis infection presenting as a Pancoast syndrome is a curiosity. However, with respect to the patients ethnical background this diagnosis should have been considered earlier.

AB  - A 49-year-old man complained of a 3-month history of progressive generalized muscle weakness. He was diagnosed as having small-cell lung carcinoma at the same time. He received an intravenous injection of edrophonium chloride with remarkable improvement of muscle strength. Electromyographic studies revealed a compound muscle action potential that decreased after repetitive stimulation. These findings were considered representative of myasthenia gravis (MG), and inconsistent with Eaton-Lambert syndrome. The appearance of MG with small-cell lung carcinoma seems to be very rare, but possible.

AB  - Twenty-nine patients with non-small cell lung cancer refractory to prior therapy were treated with either vindesine (VDS) alone (3 mg/m2 every week) or the combination of VDS plus cisplatin (DDP) (100 mg/m2 every 28 days). Serial blood and urine samples were collected to assess the pharmacokinetics of VDS and DDP. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 27 were evaluable for response. No objective antitumor responses were observed. Peripheral neuropathy manifested by paresthesias, muscle weakness, and constipation were observed in 20 treated patients, and hematologic toxicity consisting of thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia occurred in 18 patients. The plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of VDS and DDP measured in this study indicate that VDS and DDP do not interfere with each other and that the pharmacokinetics in previously treated and untreated patients are similar. The antitumor responses and degree of toxicity observed in this trial compare unfavorably with previously reported VDS and VDS-DDP trials in previously untreated patients with this disease and suggest that prior exposure to chemotherapy might both decrease antitumor activity and enhance toxicity of these chemotherapeutic agents.

AB  - In cancer-bearing animals, we previously demonstrated that skeletal muscle apoptosis may be involved in muscle wasting and that Bax may play a role in skeletal muscle cell apoptosis at an early stage. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of apoptosis in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart during cancer cachexia as well as the associations between apoptosis and the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax proteins. We also examined the relationship between normal organ apoptosis in cancer cachexia and multiple organ failure. We further studied the changes in body weight, lean body mass (LBM), apoptotic index (AI), DNA laddering pattern and expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart in VX2 carcinoma-bearing rabbits. In the early stage of tumor bearing (20 days after implantation), the LBM was significantly reduced by 19.06+/-1.02% in the tumor-bearing group compared to an increase of 1.66+/-0.83% in the control group. The apoptotic indices of the liver, kidney, lung and spleen in the tumor-bearing group increased by 14.2+/-1.8%, 34.4+/-2.0%, 66.7+/-6.0% and 24.8+/-3.8%, respectively and were significantly higher than the corresponding indices in the control group. DNA laddering patterns characteristic of DNA fragmentation were visible on day 50 in the liver, kidney, spleen and lung in the tumor-bearing group. The expression of Bax increased in the tumor-bearing group and coincided with the occurrence of apoptosis. However, no significant changes were noted in the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These findings suggest the possibility that normal organ cell apoptosis related to Bax not only causes body weight loss but also multiple organ failure in cancer cachexia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic relevance of temporal muscle thickness (TMT) in brain metastasis patients., METHODS: We retrospectively analysed TMT on magnetic resonance (MR) images at diagnosis of brain metastasis in two independent cohorts of 188 breast cancer (BC) and 247 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (overall: 435 patients)., RESULTS: Survival analysis using a Cox regression model showed a reduced risk of death by 19% with every additional millimetre of baseline TMT in the BC cohort and by 24% in the NSCLC cohort. Multivariate analysis included TMT and diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) as covariates in the BC cohort (TMT: HR 0.791/CI [0.703-0.889]/p < 0.001; DS-GPA: HR 1.433/CI [1.160-1.771]/p = 0.001), and TMT, gender and DS-GPA in the NSCLC cohort (TMT: HR 0.710/CI [0.646-0.780]/p < 0.001; gender: HR 0.516/CI [0.387-0.687]/p < 0.001; DS-GPA: HR 1.205/CI [1.018-1.426]/p = 0.030)., CONCLUSION: TMT is easily and reproducibly assessable on routine MR images and is an independent predictor of survival in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis from BC and NSCLC. TMT may help to better define frail patient populations and thus facilitate patient selection for therapeutic measures or clinical trials. Further prospective studies are needed to correlate TMT with other clinical frailty parameters of patients., KEY POINTS: * TMT has an independent prognostic relevance in brain metastasis patients. * It is an easily and reproducibly parameter assessable on routine cranial MRI. * This parameter may aid in patient selection and stratification in clinical trials. * TMT may serve as surrogate marker for sarcopenia.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and botulism are acquired presynaptic nerve terminal disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is an idiopathic or paraneoplastic autoimmune syndrome in which autoantibodies of the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel play a role in decreasing the release of acetylcholine, resulting in clinical symptoms of skeletal muscle weakness, diminished reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. Paraneoplastic LEMS is most often associated with small cell lung cancer. Diagnosis is confirmed by positive serologic testing and electrophysiological studies, which display characteristic features of low compound muscle action potentials, a decrement at 3Hz repetitive nerve stimulation, and facilitation with exercise or high-frequency repetitive stimulation. Treatment involves cancer monitoring and treatment, 3,4-diaminopyridine, immunosuppressive medications, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Botulism is another presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Clinical features classically involve cranial and bulbar palsies followed by descending weakness of the limbs, respiratory failure, and autonomic dysfunction. Electrodiagnostic testing is important in the evaluation and diagnosis. Treatment is supportive, and administration of antitoxin is beneficial in selected cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is associated with increased postoperative morbidity in abdominal surgery. This study aimed to determine if sarcopenia and/or abdominal fat composition could predict postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) for pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) and peritoneal mesothelioma (PM)., METHODS: All patients who underwent a complete CRS-HIPEC for PMP and PM, between January 2009 and September 2017, were retrospectively studied. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional surface of skeletal muscle mass and adipose tissue (visceral and subcutaneous), at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae, to assess for sarcopenia and abdominal fat composition., RESULTS: Among 115 patients, 82 were treated for PMP and 33 for PM. 64 patients (55.7%) were sarcopenic on the preoperative imagery. Major postoperative complications occurred in 63 patients (54.8%), without observable difference between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients (56.2% vs. 52.9%; p = 0.723). The median overall survival (OS) was 73.3 for the patients with a normal muscle mass and 57.2 months for the sarcopenic patients (p = 0.05)., CONCLUSION: CT measured sarcopenia is an independent predictive factor for overall survival in patients treated for PMP and PM with CRS-HIPEC, but cannot predict postoperative morbidity.

AB  - Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the coordinated activation of several anabolic and catabolic pathways. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site of protein folding and a reservoir for calcium ions. Accretion of misfolded proteins or depletion in calcium concentration causes stress in the ER, which leads to the activation of a signaling network known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In the present study, we investigated the role of the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function in naive conditions and in a mouse model of cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that the targeted inducible deletion of PERK reduces skeletal muscle mass, strength, and force production during isometric contractions. Deletion of PERK also causes a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PERK leads to atrophy in cultured myotubes. While increasing the rate of protein synthesis, the targeted deletion of PERK leads to the increased expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in skeletal muscle. Ablation of PERK also increases the activation of calpains and deregulates the gene expression of the members of the FGF19 subfamily. Furthermore, the targeted deletion of PERK increases muscle wasting in Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice. Our findings suggest that the PERK arm of the UPR is essential for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function in adult mice.-Gallot, Y. S., Bohnert, K. R., Straughn, A.

AB  - Cachexia is a muscle-wasting syndrome that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality of many patients with advanced cancers. However, little is understood about how the severe loss of skeletal muscle characterizing this condition occurs. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the muscle protein myostatin is involved in mediating the pathogenesis of cachexia-induced muscle wasting in tumor-bearing mice. Myostatin gene inactivation prevented the severe loss of skeletal muscle mass induced in mice engrafted with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells or in Apc(Min) (/+) mice, an established model of colorectal cancer and cachexia. Mechanistically, myostatin loss attenuated the activation of muscle fiber proteolytic pathways by inhibiting the expression of atrophy-related genes, MuRF1 and MAFbx/Atrogin-1, along with autophagy-related genes. Notably, myostatin loss also impeded the growth of LLC tumors, the number and the size of intestinal polyps in Apc(Min) (/+) mice, thus strongly increasing survival in both models. Gene expression analysis in the LLC model showed this phenotype to be associated with reduced expression of genes involved in tumor metabolism, activin signaling, and apoptosis. Taken together, our results reveal an essential role for myostatin in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia and link this condition to tumor growth, with implications for furthering understanding of cancer as a systemic disease.

AB  - Cachexia and muscle wasting are very common among patients suffering from cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic diseases. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion via the ghrelin receptor, which subsequently leads to increase of IGF-1 plasma levels. The activation of the GH/IGF-1 axis leads to an increase of muscle mass and functional capacity. Ghrelin further acts on inflammation, appetite, and adipogenesis and for this reason was considered an important target to address catabolic conditions. We report the synthesis and properties of an indane based series of ghrelin receptor full agonists; they have been shown to generate a sustained increase of IGF-1 levels in dog and have been thoroughly investigated with respect to their functional activity.

AB  - Nutritional abnormalities are frequent in different chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis (CF), interstitial fibrosis and lung cancer, having important clinical consequences. However, nutritional abnormalities often remained underdiagnosed due to the relative lack of awareness of health professionals. Therefore, systematic anthropometry or even better, assessment of body composition, should be performed in all patients with chronic respiratory conditions, especially following exacerbation periods when malnutrition becomes more accentuated. Nutritional abnormalities very often include the loss of muscle mass, which is an important factor for the occurrence of muscle dysfunction. The latter can be easily detected with the specific assessment of muscle strength and endurance, and also negatively influences patients' quality of life and prognosis. Both nutritional abnormalities and muscle dysfunction result from the interaction of several factors, including tobacco smoking, low physical activity-sedentarism, systemic inflammation and the imbalance between energy supply and requirements, which essentially lead to a negative balance between protein breakdown and synthesis. Therapeutic approaches include improvements in lifestyle, nutritional supplementation and training. Anabolic drugs may be administered in some cases.

AB  - Current body weight-based protein recommendations are ignoring the large variability in body composition, particularly lean mass (LM), which drives protein requirements. We explored and highlighted the inter-individual variability of weight versus body composition-adjusted protein intakes by secondary analysis in three cohorts of (1) 574 healthy adults (mean +/- SD age: 41.4 +/- 15.2 years); (2) 403 cirrhotic patients (age: 44.7 +/- 12.3 years) and (3) 547 patients with lung cancer (age: 61.3 +/- 8.2 years). LM was assessed using different devices (magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computer tomography, total body potassium and bioelectrical impedance), body weight-based protein intake, its ratio (per kg LM) and mean protein requirement were calculated. Variability in protein intake in all cohorts ranged from 0.83 to 1.77 g protein per kg LM per day using (theoretical protein intake of 60 g protein per day). Calculated mean protein requirement was 1.63 g protein per kg LM per day; consequently, 95.3% of healthy subjects, 100% of cirrhotic and 97.4% of cancer patients would present with a low protein intake per kg LM. Weight-adjusted recommendations are inadequate to address the LM specific differences in protein needs of healthy subjects or clinical populations. Absolute protein intake seems to be more relevant compared to the relative proportion of protein, which in turn changes with different energy needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Limitations associated with current animal models serve as a major obstacle to reliable preclinical evaluation of therapies in pancreatic cancer (PC). In an effort to develop more reliable preclinical models, we have recently established a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. However, critical aspects of PC responsible for its highly lethal nature, such as the development of distant metastasis and cancer cachexia, remain underrepresented in the flank PDX model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which an orthotopic PDX model of PC recapitulates these aspects of the human disease., METHODS: Human PDX-derived PC tumors were implanted directly into the pancreas of NOD.Cg-Prkdc Il2rg/SzJ mice. Tumor growth, metastasis, and muscle wasting were then evaluated., RESULTS: Orthotopically implanted PDX-derived tumors consistently incorporated into the murine pancreatic parenchyma, metastasized to both the liver and lungs and induced muscle wasting directly proportional to the size of the tumor, consistent of the cancer cachexia syndrome., CONCLUSIONS: Through the orthotopic implantation technique described, we demonstrate a highly reproducible model that recapitulates both local and systemic aspects of human PC.

AB  - The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit.

AB  - The cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome is a systemic metabolic disorder characterized by the catabolism of stored nutrients in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that is particularly prevalent in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of skeletal muscle results in functional impairments and increased mortality. The aim of the present study was to characterize the changes in systemic metabolism in a genetically engineered mouse model of NSCLC. We show that a portion of these animals develop loss of skeletal muscle, loss of adipose tissue, and increased inflammatory markers mirroring the human cachexia syndrome. Using noncachexic and fasted animals as controls, we report a unique cachexia metabolite phenotype that includes the loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) -dependent ketone production by the liver. In this setting, glucocorticoid levels rise and correlate with skeletal muscle degradation and hepatic markers of gluconeogenesis. Restoring ketone production using the PPARalpha agonist, fenofibrate, prevents the loss of skeletal muscle mass and body weight. These results demonstrate how targeting hepatic metabolism can prevent muscle wasting in lung cancer, and provide evidence for a therapeutic strategy.

AB  - A 46-year-old woman with a 30 pack-year smoking history presented with a worsening eruption on the left cheek that failed to improve with metronidazole gel. The cutaneous eruption spread to most of her face and did not respond to a brief tapering course of prednisone. During the initial evaluation at our institution, approximately 6 weeks after the onset of the cutaneous eruption, the patient had erythematous, crusted plaques on her face and scalp (Figure 1A); they were also present on the V-area of the anterior aspect of the neck and upper region of the chest, the shoulders, and the arms, with isolated lesions on the trunk and legs. Her oral mucosa had erythematous erosions on the hard palate and gingivae. A review of systems revealed pain and burning of her skin lesions, but no muscle weakness or other systemic clinical manifestations. The differential diagnosis included autoimmune connective tissue disease, pemphigus foliaceous, sarcoidosis, lichen planus, phototoxic drug eruption, and eczema herpeticum.

AB  - A 73-year-old man had undergone resection of a lung carcinoma of the right upper lobe in 1987. Post-operative irradiation (40 Gy) was given to the right hilus. In November 1988, recurrence was detected in the trachea. Laser therapy was done in December 1988. From January 9 to February 13 in 1989, irradiation (50 Gy) was given to the mediastinum. From the beginning of 1991, the patient developed muscle weakness in the right lower extremity and pain temperature sensations were impaired below the Th12 level on the left side. On October 3, 1991, he was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed mild muscle weakness in the right lower extremity. Superficial sensations were impaired below the Th6 level bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive in the lower extremities. A bilateral Babinski sign was positive. The T1 weighted MRI showed a low signal intensity in the spinal cord at the level of thoracic vertebra (TV)2-TV6. T2 weighted images revealed a high signal intensity area of the spinal cord from TV4-TV6. A gadolinium-DTPA injection revealed an enhancement on the left side of the spinal cord at the TV2-3 level, and right side of the spinal cord at the TV4-5 level on the sagittal and axial images. A thermal sweating test revealed hypohidrosis below the Th8 level on the right side, and the Th11 level on the left side. Sweating was delayed at the Th7-8 levels on the right side and Th10-11 levels on the left side. An irradiated field on the chest revealed hypohidrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Tumor-induced skeletal muscle wasting (SMW) contributes to the fatigue and weakness experienced by persons with cancer cachexia. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity have been implicated in SMW in some animal models of cancer cachexia. We report that indomethacin, a nonspecific inhibitor of COX, and NS398, a specific inhibitor of COX2, preserved muscle mass and reduced type 1 TNF receptors in muscles of mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma, but not in mice bearing the B16 melanoma. These data suggest that tumor-induced SMW can occur via a COX2-independent pathway. The COX2-dependent pathway may involve reducing the catabolic effects of TNFa in muscle. Further study is needed to understand the relationship between COX and SMW, and whether patients with cancer cachexia might benefit from COX inhibitors. Copyright 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle and is required to be highly active throughout the life span. The diaphragm muscle must be able to produce and sustain various behaviors that range from ventilatory to nonventilatory such as those required for airway maintenance and clearance. Throughout the life span various circumstances and conditions may affect the ability of the diaphragm muscle to generate requisite forces, and in turn the diaphragm muscle may undergo significant weakness and dysfunction. For example, hypoxic stress, critical illness, cancer cachexia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and age-related sarcopenia all represent conditions in which significant diaphragm muscle dysfunction exits. This perspective review article presents several interesting topics involving diaphragm plasticity in aging and disease that were presented at the International Union of Physiological Sciences Conference in 2017. This review seeks to maximize the broad and collective research impact on diaphragm muscle dysfunction in the search for transformative treatment approaches to improve the diaphragm muscle health during aging and disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies show that low skeletal muscle index (SMI) and low skeletal muscle density (SMD) are negative prognostic factors and associated with more toxicity from systemic therapy in cancer patients. However, muscle depletion can be caused by a range of diseases, and many cancer patients have significant co-morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there were associations between co-morbidity and muscle measures in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer., METHODS: Patients in a Phase III trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens in advanced non-small cell lung cancer were analysed (n = 436). Co-morbidity was assessed using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G), which rates co-morbidity from 0 to 4 on 14 different organ scales. Severe co-morbidity was defined as having any grades 3 and 4 CIRS-G score. Muscle measures were assessed from baseline computed tomography slides at the L3 level using the SliceOMatic software., RESULTS: Complete data were available for 263 patients (60%). Median age was 66, 57.0% were men, 78.7% had performance status 0-1, 25.9% Stage IIIB, 11.4% appetite loss, 92.4% were current/former smokers, 22.8% were underweight, 43.7% had normal weight, 26.6% were overweight, and 6.8% obese. The median total CIRS-G score was 7 (range: 0-16), and 48.2% had severe co-morbidity. Mean SMI was 44.7 cm2 /m2 (range: 27-71), and the mean SMD was 37.3 Hounsfield units (HU) (range: 16-60). When comparing patients with and without severe co-morbidity, there were no significant differences in median SMI (44.5 vs. 44.1 cm2 /m2 ; 0.70), but patients with severe co-morbidity had a significantly lower median SMD (36 HU vs. 39 HU; 0.001), mainly due to a significant difference in SMD between those with severe heart disease and those without (32.5 vs. 37.9 HU; 0.002). Linear regression analyses confirmed the association between severe co-morbidity and SMD both in the simple analysis (0.001) and the multiple analysis (0.037) adjusting for baseline characteristics. Stage of disease, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with SMI in both the simple and multiple analyses. Age and BMI were significantly associated with SMD in the simple analysis; and age, gender, and BMI were significantly associated in the multiple analysis., CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in SMI between patients with and patients without severe co-morbidity, but patients with severe co-morbidity had lower SMD than other patients, mainly due to severe heart disease. Co-morbidity might be a confounder in studies of the clinical role of SMD in cancer patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that administration of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor, in combination with high-dose interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b), an inhibitor of basic fibroblast growth factor, would have clinical activity in patients with metastatic ocular melanoma., METHODS: Patients with metastatic ocular melanoma received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus IFN-alpha2b (5 MU/m subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 2 weeks followed by a dose of 10 MU/m subcutaneously thereafter). Patients exhibiting a clinical response or stabilization of disease were treated until disease progression., RESULTS: In this pilot study, 5 patients were treated (3 men, 2 women) with a mean age of 63.8 years (range, 53-71 years). Overall, the regimen was well-tolerated. The following adverse events were noted: grade 3 dyspnea (2 patients), grade 3 and 4 fatigue (2), grade 3 muscle weakness (1), grade 3 anorexia (1), grade 1 and 2 proteinuria (2), and grade 3 diarrhea (1). All adverse events resolved with a treatment holiday or dose reduction. One patient had reduction in tumor burden of 23% by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria and 2 patients had stabilization of disease lasting 28 and 36 weeks, respectively. Two patients failed to respond and progressed after 6 and 7 weeks of therapy., CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab and IFN-alpha2b were well tolerated in this patient population, and clinical activity was observed. Further study of high-dose IFN-alpha2b in combination with bevacizumab in this setting is warranted.

AB  - Factors secreted from tumors/tumor cells are hypothesized to cause skeletal muscle wasting in cancer patients. We examined whether cancer cells secrete factors to promote atrophy by evaluating the effects of conditioned media (CM) from murine lung cancer cells and primary cultures of human lung tumor cells on cultured myotubes. We evaluated murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and KRASG12D cells, and primary cell lines derived from tumor biopsies from patients with lung cancer (hTCM; n = 6). In all experiments, serum content was matched across treatment groups. We hypothesized that CM from murine and human tumor cells would reduce myotube myosin content, decrease mitochondrial content, and increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Treatment of myotubes differentiated for 7 days with CM from LLC and KRASG12D cells did not alter any of these variables. Effects of murine tumor cell CM were observed when myotubes differentiated for 4 days were treated with tumor cell CM and compared with undiluted differentiation media. However, these effects were not apparent if tumor cell CM treatments were compared with control cell CM or dilution controls. Finally, CM from human lung tumor primary cell lines did not modify myosin content or mitochondrial content or ROS production compared with either undiluted differentiated media, control cell CM, or dilution controls. Our results do not support the hypothesis that factors released from cultured lung cancer/tumor cells promote myotube wasting or mitochondrial abnormalities, but we cannot dismiss the possibility that these cells could secrete such factors in vivo within the native tumor microenvironment.

AB  - Muscular atrophy or muscle loss is a multifactorial clinical condition during many critical illnesses like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, pulmonary diseases etc. leading to fatigue and weakness and contributes towards a decreased quality of life. The proportion of older adults (>65 y) in the overall population is also growing and aging is another important factor causing muscle loss. Some muscle miRNAs (myomiRs) and their target genes have even been proposed as potential diagnostic, therapeutic and predictive markers for muscular atrophy. MyomirDB (http://www.myomirdb.in/) is a unique resource that provides a comprehensive, curated, user- friendly and detailed compilation of various miRNA bio-molecular interactions; miRNA-Transcription Factor-Target Gene co-regulatory networks and ~8000 tripartite regulons associated with 247 myomiRs which have been experimentally validated to be associated with various muscular atrophy conditions. For each database entry, MyomirDB compiles source organism, muscle atrophic condition, experiment duration, its level of expression, fold change, tissue of expression, experimental validation, disease and drug association, tissue-specific expression level, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway associations. The web resource is a unique server platform which uses in-house scripts to construct miRNA-Transcription Factor-Target Gene co-regulatory networks and extract tri-partite regulons also called Feed Forward Loops. These unique features helps to offer mechanistic insights in disease pathology. Hence, MyomirDB is a unique platform for researchers working in this area to explore, fetch, compare and analyse atrophy associated miRNAs, their co-regulatory networks and FFL regulons.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide killing nearly 3 million people annually. Even the most optimistic estimates suggest that COPD mortality rates will increase by 50% over the next 15 years. Individuals with COPD are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), lung cancer, osteoporosis and muscle wasting. Smoking is a well-described risk factor for both COPD and CVD, but CVD in patients with COPD is likely to be due to other factors in addition to smoking. Systemic inflammation may be an important common etiological cause between COPD and CVD, being well described in both diseases. This paper reviews the close relationship between COPD and cardiovascular diseases, principally atherosclerosis. The common pathogenetic mechanisms, relation between cardiovascular comorbidities and pulmonary function parameters, the treatment of pulmonary and systemic inflammation, the role medications in the treatment of both disorders, the effect of cardiovascular comorbidities on the prognosis of COPD and prediction of mortality is discussed. The anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled corticosteroids and statins, their effects on cardiovascular endpoints, all-cause mortality, and survival of COPD patients are reviewed as a new perspective to the treatment.

AB  - A 66-year-old man with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, polyneuropathy, and small cell lung cancer, developed profound muscle weakness with a prolonged period of ventilatory dependency. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated very small compound muscle action potentials in response to supramaximal nerve stimulation, limited tetanic and postexercise facilitation, and prolonged prominent postexercise exhaustion (40-60% of baseline value) persisting up to 20 minutes. It is hypothesized that these changes may reflect both a severe defect in acetylcholine release and decreased availability of releasible acetylcholine from the terminal axon.

AB  - Muscle weakness is a common complaint in clinical practice. If this symptom is combined with focal liver lesions there is a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses for the gastroenterologist to consider. Tumors of neuroendocrine origin such as small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) produce a wide array of peptide hormones and are common causes of paraneoplastic syndromes. We report on a 68-year-old woman who presented with progressing muscle fatigue and multiple liver lesions on ultrasonography. Hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis prompted consideration of underlying hypercortisolism. Further work-up demonstrated an acute ectopic ACTH syndrome as paraneoplastic manifestation of a small cell lung carcinoma. The woman deteriorated rapidly and finally died from intracranial tumor spread and septic complications. This case stresses the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of acute ectopic ACTH syndrome in the setting of SCLC.

AB  - Generalized subcutaneous edema is a very rare manifestation of inflammatory myopathies. A 61-year-old woman presented with classic signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis. She was also noted to have generalized edema that was so florid that an alternative diagnosis was considered. Her disease was resistant to corticosteroids, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulins was started because of marked worsening of her disease-muscle weakness, generalized anasarca, and involvement of her bulbar muscles. This led to dramatic resolution of her subcutaneous edema and significant improvement of her skin and muscle disease. As the initial screen for malignancy was negative, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan was requested, which interestingly showed a metabolically active cervical tumor. Anasarca is an unusual manifestation of dermatomyositis. In treatment-refractory cases, it seems reasonable to consider positron emission tomography scan in excluding underlying malignant disease.

AB  - A 76-year-old woman who was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer presented with left eyelid ptosis and grade 4 creatine phosphokinase elevation after the second cycle of nivolumab monotherapy. Nivolumab has demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in several trials. Dyspnea and muscle weakness developed rapidly with an acute exacerbation. She underwent plasmapheresis and intravenous immune globulin followed by treatment with low-dose prednisolone. She had gradual symptoms improvement. We diagnosed her with myasthenia gravis (MG) based on her symptoms and the detection of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody. According to postmarketing surveillance in 15,740 Japanese patients, the total incidence rate of MG is 0.1%. We report a rare case of drug-induced MG in a patient receiving nivolumab.

AB  - A 69-year-old man was admitted with neck muscle weakness, symmetric proximal muscle weakness, skin rash and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Muscle biopsy showed perifascicular necrosis and perimysial alkaline phosphatase activity. Chest CT revealed interstitial lung disease and colorectal cancer was diagnosed on colonoscopy. He was serologically positive for anti-EJ antibody, leading to the diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome (ASS). After laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum, he received intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (50 mg/d). Although his muscle weakness improved after corticosteroid therapy, he developed pericardial effusion with resultant asymptomatic hypotension and arrhythmia possibly due to pericarditis. Corticosteroid monotherapy was insufficient to control the disease, and, we decided to use oral cyclosporin concurrently. After this combined therapy started, pericardial effusion and arrhythmia were improved. We should keep in mind that pericarditis can occur in patients with anti-EJ antibody-positive ASS, and early combined therapy with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs for ASS may improve the patient's prognosis.

AB  - Cancer-induced cachexia, characterized by systemic inflammation, body weight loss, adipose tissue (AT) remodeling and muscle wasting, is a malignant metabolic syndrome with undefined etiology. Here, we show that both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 were able to attenuate the main clinical markers of cachexia in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). AT remodelling was not found in LLC tumor-bearing (TB) TLR4-/- mice due to reduced macrophage infiltration and adipocyte atrophy. TLR4-/- mice were also resistant to cold-induced browning of subcutaneous AT (scAT). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 (Atorvastatin) reproduced the main protective effect against AT remodeling found in TLR4-/- TB mice. Moreover, the treatment was effective in prolonging survival and attenuating tumor mass growth when compared to non-treated-TB animals. Furthermore, tumor-induced elevation of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines was similarly abolished in both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of TLR4. These data suggest that TLR4 is a critical mediator and a promising target for novel anti-cachexia therapies.

AB  - Two disorders of neuromuscular transmission producing muscle weakness and easy fatigability which may confront the physician are myasthenia gravis and the myasthenic syndrome. The former has early symptoms and signs of oculobulbar and then extremity weakness with rapid decline of action potential and contractile strength with repetitive use and nerve-muscle stimulation. Anticholinesterases improve strength. The myasthenic syndrome has early symptoms and signs of pelvic girdle, pectoral girdle and proximal limb muscle weakness. This is worst when first starting to use or carry out nerve muscle stimulation in the rested muscles. It improves significantly for a time with use or on rapid stimulation, and then declines with continued activation. Deep tendon reflexes are sluggish or absent. Small cell carcinoma of the lung is often associated. Guanidine improves the strength. Other features and possible underlying mechanisms of the two disorders help to differentiate and treat them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothesizing that morphometric measurements are reliable markers of fitness in patients with lung cancer requiring aggressive surgical intervention, the purpose of this study was to assess their impact on postoperative outcome and long-term survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requiring pneumonectomy., METHODS: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), as well as usual clinical, laboratory (including C-reactive protein [CRP] concentrations), and pathologic data were retrospectively retrieved from files of 161 consecutive patients treated by pneumonectomy for NSCLC, whose preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans were available in the Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) of the hospital. Cross-sectional areas of right and left psoas areas (measured by CT scan at the L3 level), perirenal fat thickness, and anterior subcutaneous tissue thickness at the left renal vein level were also assessed., RESULTS: BMI and total psoas area were strongly and directly correlated (p = 0.0000001), whereas BMI was inversely related to CRP levels. Sarcopenia (total psoas area <=33rd percentile) was associated with high CRP levels (>20 mg/L) (p = 0.010). Factors associated with 90-day mortality included older age (p = 0.000045), lower body weight (p = 0.032), and BMI less than or equal to 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.013). At univariate analysis, long-term outcome was negatively affected by a nonsquamous cell histologic type (p = 0.011), pathologic stage IIIB-IV (p =0.026), CRP levels greater than 20 mg/L (p = 0.017), BMI less than or equal to 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.010), and total psoas area less than or equal to the 33rd percentile (p = 0.029). Multivariate analysis showed the independent prognostic value of both BMI and total psoas area., CONCLUSIONS: BMI less than or equal to 25 kg/m2 and total psoas cross-sectional area less than or equal to the 33rd percentile are prognostic determinants in patients with NSCLC requiring pneumonectomy.

AB  - A new clinical entity under the name of "juvenile muscular atrophy of unilateral upper extremity" was first described in 1959. Although about 150 cases in Japan, and several additional cases in other countries, have been clinically reported in the literature, the pathology has remained unknown because of the benign course of the disease. The first necropsy findings are reported, obtained from a patient with this disease, who died of lung cancer at the age of 38, 23 years after the onset of the disease. The lesions existed only in the anterior horns of the spinal cord at C5 approximately T1, particularly marked at C7 and C8, showing shrinkage and necrosis, degeneration of various degrees of large and small nerve cells, and mild gliosis. The pathological findings differ from those of reported cases of spinal vascular disorders, but some circulatory insufficiency in the territory of the spinal cord would seem to be suggested, although the underlying aetiology remains unknown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of severe, acute limiting toxicity in patients receiving anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, is largely unpredictable. Sarcopenia was found to be associated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 acute toxicity. We explore the clinical and pharmacological parameters influencing nivolumab toxicity, including body composition., METHODS: From June 2015 to January 2017, all consecutive patients treated with nivolumab in our institution were prospectively included. We studied the relationship between muscle mass assessed by computed tomography, nivolumab trough level (Cmin) at day 14 assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and the occurrence of immune grade III or IV toxicity or any toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation (immune-related acute limiting toxicity [irALT])., RESULTS: In our population (n = 92) with a majority of lung cancer (72%), forty-five (51.7%) patients were sarcopenic. The median plasma nivolumab Cmin at day 14 was 15.4 mug/mL (interquartile range = 11.8-21.0). In multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) was independently associated with low nivolumab Cmin on day 14 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.59, p = 0.01) and overweight/obesity with high nivolumab Cmin on day 14 (OR = 5.94; 95% CI = 1.25-28.29, p = 0.03). We observed 22 irALTs in 19 patients (21%). The most frequent irALT was respiratory (6.5%) disorders and gastrointestinal (4.3%) disorders. Patients with sarcopenia were at significantly increased risk of experiencing an irALT (OR = 3.84; 95% CI = 1.02-14.46, p = 0.047). No association was found between toxicity and nivolumab plasma Cmin at day 14., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of assessing body composition and suggest that sarcopenia could predict severe immune-related toxicity of nivolumab in real life.

AB  - Muscle wasting is a decline in skeletal muscle mass and function that is associated with aging, obesity, and a spectrum of pathologies including cancer. Cancer-associated wasting not only reduces quality of life, but also directly impacts cancer mortality, chemotherapeutic efficacy, and surgical outcomes. There is an incomplete understanding of the role of tumor-derived factors in muscle wasting and sparse knowledge of how these factors impact in vivo muscle regeneration. Here, we identify several cytokines/chemokines that negatively impact in vitro myogenic differentiation. We show that one of these cytokines, CXCL1, potently antagonizes in vivo muscle regeneration and interferes with in vivo muscle satellite cell homeostasis. Strikingly, CXCL1 triggers a robust and specific neutrophil/M2 macrophage response that likely underlies or exacerbates muscle repair/regeneration defects. Taken together, these data highlight the pleiotropic nature of a novel tumor-derived cytokine and underscore the importance of cytokines in muscle progenitor cell regulation.

AB  - A 68-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of muscle weakness. A complete medical examination led to a diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Four courses of chemotherapy (carboplatin + etoposide) and one of radiotherapy with a total dose of 45 Gy to the mediastinum were performed and resulted in a partial response in the SCLC. After the second course of chemotherapy, the serum level of antivoltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) antibody decreased from 190 pg/ml to 120 pg/ml. Marked improvement of the muscle weakness was recognized only after 3 courses of chemotherapy. The patient, who had had difficulty in standing, recovered enough to be able to climb stairs after 4 courses of chemotherapy. Marked improvement of LEMS was achieved by treatment for small cell lung carcinoma.

AB  - Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a disorder characterized by unintended weight loss due to skeletal muscle wasting and adipose tissue loss. Although muscle atrophy in this condition has been well studied, the mechanisms underlying adipose tissue loss, which include browning, have not been investigated in detail. In this respect, though recent studies have shown that exosomes from cancer cells can promote lipolysis, the link between exosomes from cancer cells and CAC has not been clearly established. In this study, we investigate if exosomes from Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells can induce lipolysis in vitro (in 3T3-L1 adipocytes) and in vivo (in LLC tumor-bearing mice). We find that exosomes from LLC cells do induce lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that the white adipose tissues of mice with LLC tumors show clear signs of lipolysis. We also find that this lipolysis can be inhibited using the neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869. Our results indicate that GW4869 not only inhibits exosome generation and release from LLC cells, but can also inhibit lipolysis induced by LLC-derived exosomes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that LLC tumor-bearing mice treated with GW4869 did not develop CAC. In summary, our results suggest that inhibiting exosome generation and release can inhibit lipolysis and adipose tissue browning, and may be useful as a novel strategy for treating CAC.

AB  - Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) constitutes a metabolic dysfunction characterized by systemic inflammation and body weight loss. Muscle atrophy and adipose tissue lipolysis might explain weight loss in CAC. Specific functions of numerous hormones and cytokines derived from tumours can provoke cachexia. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be involved in intercellular communication. However, whether EVs participate in this process has not been investigated thoroughly. Using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell cultures, we tested whether LLC-derived EVs induced C2C12 myotube atrophy and 3T3-L1 adipocyte lipolysis. EVs derived from LLC cells and serum from patients with lung cancer, non-lung cancer controls, tumour-bearing mice, and non-tumour-bearing control mice were isolated and characterized biochemically and biophysically. LLC cell-derived EVs induced dose-dependent effects of atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mechanistically, EVs directly fused with target C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and transferred interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates the STAT3 signalling pathway in C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Neutralization of extracellular IL-6 prevented the atrophy and lipolysis effects of EVs. Inhibiting the STAT3 signalling pathway also prevented the atrophy and lipolysis effects of EVs. PKH67-labelled (PKH 67 is a lipid dye that can be used to label extracellular vesicles) LLC-EVs were readily internalized into myotubes and adipocytes. Our data showed that LLC cell-derived EVs induced myotube atrophy and adipocyte lipolysis via the extracellular IL-6-mediated STAT3 pathway in target cells. These findings represent a potentially novel basis for further research in this field towards identifying targets and developing strategies for maintaining weight in CAC.

AB  - Oncogenic osteomalacia is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome. It is characterized by bone pain, muscle weakness, gait disturbance, fractures and skeletal deformities. Hypophosphatemia, diminished renal phosphate reabsorption, decreased 1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D and elevated alkaline phosphatase are the biochemical hallmarks of this disorder. Most tumors are of mesenchymal origin. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman with oncogenic osteomalacia caused by osteosarcoma of the right scapula which was unrecognized for several years. She subsequently developed tertiary hyperparathyroidism after treatment with oral phosphate and Vitamin D. This case illustrates that oncogenic osteomalacia may persist for many years before the tumor is discovered. This is because the tumors are frequently very small and are in obscure locations. The uniqueness of this case is the coexistence of hyperparathyroidism and oncogenic osteomalacia. Five other cases have been reported up to date. All patients had received phosphate supplement, ranging from 10 to 14 years prior to their diagnosis. Interestingly, our patient was on the treatment for only 2 years. The proposed mechanism is that exogenous phosphate stimulates parathyroid activity through sequestration of calcium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) is whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The efficacy is limited. It might be increased by a potent radiosensitizer such as gemcitabine, which is believed to cross the disrupted blood-brain barrier. The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly gemcitabine given concurrently with WBRT., METHODS: Patients with BM from NSCLC were included. The dose of WBRT was 3750 cGy (total 15 times, 3 weeks). Gemcitabine was given concurrently with WBRT on days 1, 8 and 15. The starting dose was 400 mg/m(2), escalated by 100 mg/m(2) increments. At least three patients were included per level. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 4 hematological or grade 2 neurological toxicity. When two or more patients experience DLT, the MTD was reached., RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were included; 69% had a performance status (PS) 1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG). A total of 69% had concurrent active extra cranial diseases. All had more than 3 BM. Up to 600 mg/m(2) (level 3) no neurology toxicity was observed. At 600 mg/m(2) two out of 9 patients developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia. One of the two patients' thrombocytopenia was confused with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). At 700 mg/m(2) two out of 4 patients developed neurotoxicities. One developed grade 3 seizure and cognitive disorder. Another patient developed suspected grade 2 muscle weakness., CONCLUSIONS: The MTD was reached at a dose of 700 mg/m(2). The dose of 600 mg/m(2) would be considered for further study.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. In 90% of the LEMS patients the disease is associated with auto-antibodies against the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). Several auto-immune responses against other antigenic targets have been described to (co)-occur in LEMS patients. To identify new LEMS associated small cell lung cancer (SCLC) markers immunoprecipitation with a SCLC cell line was performed. We discovered strong immunoreactivity against the 120 kDa large ERC1 protein in one tumor-negative VGCC-positive LEMS patient. A recombinant ELISA assay and a cellular assay expressing GFP-tagged full length ERC1 were used to confirm the presence of auto-antibodies against ERC1 in this patient. Additional testing of 58 LEMS patients including 9 VGCC auto-antibody negative LEMS patients, 48 myasthenia gravis patients, 84 control patients with other diseases and 12 healthy controls revealed no other cases. ERC1 is therefore a new, but rare, antigen in LEMS. Copyright © 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) describes a rare human autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness that is caused by the presence of antibodies directed against their voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). These channels are localized in the presynaptic membrane of their motor nerve terminals. Binding of autoimmune antibodies to the VGCCs leads to reduced neuromuscular transmission. In approximately 50% of the patients, LEMS is reflected by a paraneoplastic manifestation and most commonly associated with a small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) whose cells also express VGCCs in their plasma membrane. Better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of LEMS has helped with the development of new diagnostic approaches and has led to targeted symptomatic and immunosuppressive therapy. For LEMS patients with an underlying malignancy, tumor therapy is the first choice to date. Copyright © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the physical performance and psychosocial status of lung cancer patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with predominantly advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were recruited. Muscle strength was assessed via hand-held dynamometry (HHD) and endurance capacity via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and results were compared to healthy reference values. Psychosocial status, lung cancer-specific symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were evaluated., RESULTS: 39 patients (NSCLC n = 22, SCLC n = 17) with predominantly advanced-stage disease and a median age of 62 years (range 44-83 years) were enrolled. Compared to a healthy reference population, mean muscle strength values of upper (elbow flexion -28.2% (+/-17.5), elbow extension -12.4% (+/-11.1)) and lower (knee extension -47.6% (+/-19.3), hip abduction -44.9% (+/-14.9), hip flexion -13% (+/-24.2)) extremities, and 6MWT were lower (male/female: 434/411 m vs. 597/514 m). Lung cancer-specific symptoms and QoL were comparable to published data., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that lung cancer patients experience muscular weakness, lower endurance performance, and decreased QoL compared to a healthy reference population. The feasibility and benefit of a structured exercise intervention in this specific population need to be evaluated, in particular its effect on psychosocial well-being. Copyright © 2014 S.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is characterized by muscle weakness. LEMS is usually associated with cancer, most commonly small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The potassium-channel blocker 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), has been previously used for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS. 3,4-DAP increases the release of acetylcholine and prolongs the duration of nerve action potentials at the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. The present study describes the case of a patient with LEMS and SCLC, for which the symptoms did not improve with anticancer therapy, but did so markedly following treatment with 3,4-DAP. The present study illustrates that 3,4-DAP is a useful treatment choice in patients with LEMS, particularly for patients who do not fully improve following anticancer therapy.

AB  - Lower pre-surgery Body Mass Index (BMI) and low muscle mass impact negatively long-term survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated their influence on survival after major lung resection for NSCLC., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was made on 304 consecutive patients., RESULTS: Underweight, normal, overweight and obese patients represented 7.6%, 51.6%, 28.6%, and 12.6% of the pre-disease population. Weight loss and gain were recorded in 5% and 44.4% of patients, respectively. Low muscle mass was more frequently associated with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (p < 0.000001). Overall survival was positively affected by pre-disease (p = 0.036) and pre-surgery (p = 0.017) BMI > 25 kg/m2, and, even more, in case of BMI > 25 kg/m2 and increasing weight (p = 0.012). Long-term outcome was negatively influenced by low muscle mass (p = 0.042) and weight loss (p = 0.0052) as well as age (p = 0.017), ASA categories (p = 0.025), extent of resection (p = 0.0001), pleural invasion (p = 0.0012) and higher pathologic stage (p < 0.0001). Three stepwise multivariable models confirmed the independent favorable prognostic value of higher pre-disease (RR 0.66[0.49-0.89], p = 0.006) and pre-surgery BMI (RR 0.72[0.54-0.98], p = 0.034), and the absence of low muscle mass (RR 0.56[0.37-0.87], p = 0.0091)., CONCLUSIONS: Body reserves assessed by simple clinical markers impact survival of surgically treated NSCLC. Strategies improving body fat and muscular mass before surgery should be considered.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report., OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of solitary metastasis of the seventh thoracic vertebra (T7) from lung cancer 15 years after surgery., SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Late recurrence of the bone over 5 years after curative surgery for lung cancer is highly exceptional. In addition, bone metastasis from lung cancer showing a coarse trabecular pattern of the vertebra on computed tomography (CT) is quite unusual., METHODS: A case of solitary metastasis of T7 from lung cancer 15 years after surgery showing a pseudohemangioma appearance of the vertebra on CT is presented., RESULTS: A 66-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of gradually progressed numbness and muscle weakness of the bilateral leg, with a more recently developed spastic gate. He had undergone a left lower lobectomy for lung cancer 15 years previously. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an ill-defined mass lesion involving the entire vertebral body of T7 with extension into the posterior element and surrounding soft tissue, which resulted in moderate spinal canal stenosis. CT showed a coarse trabecular pattern at T7 with a mild compression fracture. No other lesion was detected by whole-body CT and bone scintigraphy. Tumor resection and T5-T9 posterior spinal fusion had been performed, and a pathologic diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma of the bone was established. Additional radiation therapy (40 Gy) was added, and the patient recovered and continued to survive uneventfully at the 3-month follow-up., CONCLUSION: We have reported a rare case of solitary metastasis to T7 appearing 15 years after surgery for lung cancer. The incidence of lung cancer recurrence more than 5 years after surgery is exceedingly low; however, even in patients with lung cancer, late occurrence of bone metastasis should be considered and included in the differential diagnosis of a pseudohemangioma appearance of the vertebra.

AB  - A 53-year-old man suffering from squamous cell lung cancer presented with bilateral ptosis and bulbar palsy a month after initial treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. The symptoms showed worsening from midday, suggesting myasthenia gravis (MG), although anti-AChR antibody was negative. Although no muscle weakness was detected, the CK level was elevated to 5,255 IU/l, and MRI of the thigh revealed inflammation of the bilateral rectus femoris muscle. A muscle biopsy showed signs of necrotizing myopathy with expression of sarcolemmal HLA class I and accumulation of macrophages, CD4, CD8, and CD20-positive lymphocytes. Positivity for anti-titin antibody, one of the anti-striated muscle antibodies, was evident. The patient was diagnosed as having nivolumab-related necrotizing myopathy with myasthenia gravis, an immune-related adverse event (irAE). Treatment with prednisolone rapidly ameliorated the symptoms, and the serum CK level normalized. There have been several reports of nivolumab-related myositis with MG. On the basis of the muscle pathology and antibody data, we were able to clarify that necrotizing myopathy was related to the pathogenesis of this case.

AB  - A 75 year-old man developed gait disturbance and somnolence over a period of three months. Electroencephalography indicated theta slowing and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed an increased cell count of 23/microliter and IgG of 7.2 mg/dl. He showed fatigue-inducing muscle weakness and the Harvey-Masland test demonstrated a low M-wave amplitude of 0.6 mV which increased to 3 mV with 50 Hz high-frequency stimulations. The serum titer of P/Q type anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody was quite high at 11,901 pmol/L (< 20 pmol/L). The patient was diagnosed as Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome (LEMS) although at first no carcinoma was detected. Immunoadsorption therapy with a phenilalanine absorber column resulted in a reduction in the titer of anti-VGCC antibody to half of the initial concentration, but it increased again within several days. Six repeats of immunoadsorption and concomitant administration of prednisolone at a dose of 40 mg daily succeeded in reducing the anti-VGCC antibody titer of to below 390 pmol/L. The patient's consciousness disturbance and muscle weakness improved simultaneously over the next month and the lumbar puncture and electroencephalography showed normal results. Prednisolone administration was maintained at a dose of 30 mg daily and one year after occurrence of the first symptoms, a small cell lung carcinoma was detected. There was no evidence of limbic encephalitis such as an elevation of anti-Hu antibody in his CSF and serum or abnormal signal intensities in the hippocampal formations on MR imaging. The etiology of his disturbed consciousness remained unclear, but, in the case of LEMS, it could be a manifestation of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small-cell lung carcinoma. It is noteworthy that the anti-VGCC antibody titer rose to 1,262 pmol/L 2 months before his tumor was detected and decreased to 286 pmol/L after chemotherapy. P/Q type anti-VGCC antibody could therefore be a useful tumor marker reflecting activity of small-cell carcinoma.

AB  - A 54-year old man was admitted with general fatigue, muscle weakness and dyspnea on effort. Medical examinations led to a diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Marked improvement of SCLC and symptoms of LEMS were recognized twice during chemoradiotherapy. On his third admission, he showed muscle weakness, dysaethesia, and neurodysfunction of the bladder and rectum. We initially considered these symptoms to be due to spinal metastasis because MRI findings showed multiple spinal metastases. However, electoromyogram and nerve conduction study demonstrated that his muscle weakness resulted from LEMS though dysethesia and neurodysfunction of bladder and rectum were caused by spinal metastasis. We believe that it is important to perform electomyogram and nerve conduction studies, not only radiographic findings, to detect the "hidden" symptoms of LEMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While there are validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments for use in specific cancer populations, no validated general instruments exist for use in conditions common to multiple cancers, such as muscle wasting and consequent physical disability. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a survey in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, includes items from three well known scales with general applicability to cancer patients: Katz activities of daily living (ADL), Rosow-Breslau instrumental ADL (IADL), and a subset of physical performance items from the Nagi scale., OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated properties of the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and a subset of the Nagi scale in patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) using data from MCBS linked with Medicare claims in order to understand the potential utility of the three scales in these populations; understanding patient-perceived significance was not in scope., METHODS: The study cohorts included Medicare beneficiaries aged >=65 years as of 1 January of the year of their first cancer diagnosis with one or more health assessments in a community setting in the MCBS Access to Care data from 1991 to 2009. Beneficiaries had at least two diagnoses in de-identified Medicare claims data linked to the MCBS for one of the following cancers: pancreatic, lung, or MPN. The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales were calculated to assess physical functioning over time from cancer diagnosis. Psychometric properties for each scale in each cohort were evaluated by testing for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness by comparing differences in mean scale scores over time as cancer progresses, and differences in mean scale scores before and after hospitalization (for lung cancer cohort)., RESULTS: The study cohorts included 90 patients with pancreatic cancer, 863 with lung cancer, and 135 with MPN. Among each cancer cohort, the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha generally between 0.70 and 0.90) and test-retest reliability for consecutive surveys before diagnosis and consecutive surveys after diagnosis (when patients' functioning was more stable). Compared with mean scale scores at the survey 1-2 years before cancer diagnosis (baseline), mean scale scores at the first survey after cancer diagnosis were significantly higher (P < 0.05), indicating worsening, for Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales (items scored 0-1) (0.54 vs. 1.45, 1.15 vs. 2.20, and 2.29 vs. 3.08, respectively, for pancreatic cancer; 0.73 vs. 1.24, 1.29 vs. 2.01, and 2.41 vs. 2.85 for lung cancer; and 0.44 vs. 0.86, 0.87 vs. 1.36, and 1.87 vs. 2.32 for MPN). Among lung cancer patients, scale scores increased significantly following a hospitalization, suggesting a worsening of functional status., CONCLUSIONS: The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales collected in the MCBS demonstrate acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability among patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and MPN, and are consistent with clinical worsening following diagnosis or hospitalization. These results suggest that using retrospective data may allow researchers to conduct preliminary assessments of existing PRO instruments in new populations of interest and generate useful exploratory disease information before embarking on de novo PRO development.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an uncommon disorder of neuromuscular transmission with distinctive pathophysiological, clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory features. There are two forms of LEMS. The paraneoplastic (P-LEMS) form is associated with a malignant tumor that is most frequently a small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and the autoimmune (A-LEMS) form is often related to other dysimmune diseases. Approximately 90% of LEMS patients present antibodies against presynaptic membrane P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). These antibodies are directly implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder, provoke reduced acetylcholine (ACh) at the nerve terminal and consequently lead to muscle weakness. LEMS is clinically characterized by proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction and areflexia. In clinically suspected cases, diagnoses are confirmed by serological and electrodiagnostic tests. The detection of P/Q-type VGCC antibodies is supportive when there is clinical suspicion but should be carefully interpreted in the absence of characteristic clinical or electrodiagnostic features. Typical electrodiagnostic findings (ie, reduced compound motor action potentials (CMAPs), significant decrements in the responses to low frequency stimulation and incremental responses after brief exercise or high-frequency stimulation) reflect the existence of a presynaptic transmission defect and are key confirmatory criteria. Diagnosis requires a high level of awareness and necessitates the initiation of a prompt screening and surveillance process to detect and treat malignant tumors. In clinically affected patients without cancer and after cancer treatment, symptomatic treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine or immunosuppressive agents can significantly improve neurologic symptoms and the quality of life. We present a detailed review of LEMS with special emphasis on the pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical manifestation and diagnostic procedure.

AB  - A 68-year-old man suffered right facial palsy and left deafness, however, his condition was considered to be idiopathic and he was followed. Three months later, bloody sputum and hoarseness caused him to be admitted to our hospital. An abnormal shadow was detected in the right upper lung field and adenocarcinoma of the lung with multiple brain metastases was diagnosed. He underwent gamma-knife radiosurgery for the brain lesions and subsequent systemic chemotherapy consisting of combined carboplatin and paclitaxel, which were not effective. Subsequently various neurological symptoms appeared, such as muscle weakness of the extremities, dizziness, and gait disturbance. Adenocarcinoma cells confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those in the obtained by transbronchial curetting. Whole-brain irradiation was performed, however, the neurological symptoms worsened and he died. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is difficult to diagnose while the patient is alive. It is thought that cranial neuropathy due to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a rare form of onset for lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting during cancer cachexia contributes to patient morbidity. Cachexia-induced muscle damage may be understood by comparing its symptoms with those of other skeletal muscle diseases, but currently available data are limited., METHODS: We modelled cancer cachexia in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma/colon adenocarcinoma and compared the associated muscle damage with that in a murine muscular dystrophy model (mdx mice). We measured biochemical and immunochemical parameters: amounts/localization of cytoskeletal proteins and/or Ca(2+) signalling proteins related to muscle function and abnormality. We analysed intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and compared results between the two models. Involvement of Ca(2+)-permeable channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) was examined by inoculating Lewis lung carcinoma cells into transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative TRPV2., RESULTS: Tumourigenesis caused loss of body and skeletal muscle weight and reduced muscle force and locomotor activity. Similar to mdx mice, cachexia muscles exhibited myolysis, reduced sarcolemmal sialic acid content, and enhanced lysosomal exocytosis and sarcolemmal localization of phosphorylated Ca(2+)/CaMKII. Abnormal autophagy and degradation of dystrophin also occurred. Unlike mdx muscles, cachexia muscles did not exhibit regeneration markers (centrally nucleated fibres), and levels of autophagic proteolytic pathway markers increased. While a slight accumulation of TRPV2 was observed in cachexia muscles, Ca(2+) influx via TRPV2 was not elevated in cachexia-associated myotubes, and the course of cachexia pathology was not ameliorated by dominant-negative inhibition of TRPV2., CONCLUSIONS: Thus, cancer cachexia may induce muscle damage through TRPV2-independent mechanisms distinct from those in muscular dystrophy; this may help treat patients with tumour-induced muscle wasting.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data on acute geriatric patients' nutritional status are lacking, and the associations among physical function, sarcopenia, health status and nutritional status are not sufficiently investigated in this population. The aims of this study are to investigate (1) nutritional status and sarcopenia in a group of acute geriatric patients, (2) the association between nutritional status, physical function and sarcopenia in acute geriatric patients, controlling for health status., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., SETTING: Two acute geriatric hospital wards in Norway., PARTICIPANTS: This study included 120 patients with a mean age of 82.6+/-8 years. The following inclusion criteria were used: age >=65 years and admitted to an acute geriatric ward. The exclusion criteria included terminal illness, Mini-Mental State Examination <23, language difficulties or severe aphasia., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Physical function was measured using the Barthel activities of daily life index and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the mid-arm muscle circumference, gait speed and grip strength, in accordance with the EWGSOP algorithm. Diseases are organised by organ system classification., RESULTS: On the basis of the MNA classification, nearly one in two patients were at risk of malnutrition, while one in four were malnourished. Sarcopenia was present in 30% of the patients. A multivariate linear regression model was estimated and showed significant independent associations between SPPB score (beta 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.90), sarcopenia (beta -3.3, 95% CI -4.9 to -1.7), pulmonary disease (beta -2.1, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.46), cancer (beta -1.7, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.033) and nutritional status., CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a high prevalence of risk of malnutrition, malnutrition and sarcopenia. Further, the results indicate that a low total SPPB score, sarcopenia, cancer and pulmonary disease are significantly associated with declines in nutritional status, as measured by the MNA, in acute geriatric patients.

AB  - Muscle wasting is a common and prominent feature of advanced cancer, including lung cancer. Evidence from animal experiments suggests that accelerated proteolysis via the ubiquitin--proteasome pathway is the primary cause of cancer-related cachexia. However, there are few data on the role of this pathway in determining muscle wasting in human cancer. The present study was designed to measure whether skeletal muscle gene expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and/or the lysosomal proteolytic pathway was increased in patients with early lung cancer. A total of 36 patients with lung cancer referred for curative resection and 10 control subjects had biopsies of latissimus dorsi muscle taken at operation. mRNA levels of four components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, i.e. polyubiquitin, C2 alpha proteasome subunit, 14 kDa ubiquitin-carrier protein and ubiquitin-activating protein, and of two lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, i.e. cathepsin B and cathepsin D, were measured using quantitative Northern blotting. mRNA levels for cathepsin B, but not for components of the ubiquitin--proteasome pathway, were higher in patients with cancer compared with controls (P=0.01). Among lung cancer patients, cathepsin B mRNA levels correlated with fat-free mass index (r = -0.57, P=0.003) and tumour stage (r(s)=0.45, P=0.03), and were higher in smokers (P=0.04). Thus gene expression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B is increased in the skeletal muscle of patients with early lung cancer, and the strong inverse relationship with fat-free mass suggests that cathepsin B may have a role in inducing muscle wasting in the early stages of lung cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, cancer cachexia, and sarcopenia often co-occur in patients with advanced cancer and are associated with poorer response to chemotherapy and reduced survival. Here, we evaluate the current literature regarding the role of nutrition and these associated conditions in patients with advanced lung cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: While rates of malnutrition are high, nutritional intervention studies have generally been limited by small sample sizes. Novel strategies such as home-based meal delivery may have promise. While no therapy is approved for cancer cachexia, ghrelin agonists and other targeted therapies have yielded promising data in clinical trials. Recent data also suggest that obesity may improve immunotherapy responsiveness. Malnutrition and associated muscle wasting are clearly negative prognostic markers in advanced lung cancer. Patients with malnutrition should be urgently referred for dietary counseling and guidelines for nutritional support should be followed. Optimal treatment of these syndromes will likely include nutrition and anti-cachexia interventions used in combination.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Skeletal muscle mass loss is an emerging concern in oncology. Our systematic review and meta-analysis identified the mean difference in skeletal muscle index pre- to post-chemotherapy and synthesized potential key factors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched primary original research published through October 2019 in four databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase., RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, 60% published in the past 2 years (2018-2019). Advanced non-small cell lung cancer was the most frequently reported cancer, and overall survival the most often identified key related factor. Mean difference in skeletal muscle index during chemotherapy was 2.72 (95%CI=1.77-3.67, p=0.00), with muscle loss in males (4.52, 95%CI=3.34-5.71, p=0.00) about 1.6 times higher than that in females (2.86, 95%CI=0.81-4.92, p=0.01)., CONCLUSION: Oncologists should recognize sex-specific differences in skeletal muscle mass loss during chemotherapy and consider adjusting treatment accordingly.

AB  - The paper presents current news on the possibilities of conducting rehabilitation of patients suffering from lung cancer. It presents the principles of conducting and contraindications for pulmonary rehabilitation for these patients according to current guidelines of American College of Sport Medicine. The methods of measuring exercise capacity for patients with lung cancer have been discussed. The value of ergospirometrial test with maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)) in predicting not only the survival of patients with lung cancer, but also assessing the possibility of pulmonary rehabilitation programs has been highlighted. In the part devoted to physical training for patients before a surgery for lung cancer, current research results have been presented- these show that even a short, high intensity program of pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with lung cancer before surgery is effective and increases the safety of both- the safety of the surgery and extends survival time after operation for lung cancer. The paper describes difficulties in the implementation of rehabilitation programs after surgery conducted on patients with lung cancer resulting from dysfunction of cardiovascular and muscle atrophy - both skeletal and respiratory. The issue of patients with inoperable lung cancer treated with chemotherapy has been discussed so far in only one paper published in 2007. The results shown in it have been discussed as well. The authors demonstrated a significant improvement in the efficiency of respiratory-circulatory system assessed by six-minute walk test, although the rehabilitation program was graduated by small number of patients (44%). It was noted that patients with inoperable lung cancer now account for a large group of patients who use this type of medical intervention and can significantly improve the quality of life and the method shows positive impact on the survival rate.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular junction disorder which may present as a paraneoplastic phenomenon or a primary autoimmune disorder. More than half of the cases are associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The primary clinical manifestation is muscle weakness. The pathology is due to the generation of antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) on presynaptic nerve terminals leading to a decrease in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). This topic will review the pathogenesis, diagnostic testing, and treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.[1][2][3][4][5] Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibitors has a manageable adverse effect profile, although rare immune-related adverse events (irAE) can occur., CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an autoimmune polymyositis following a partial response to combination tremelimumab and durvalumab for the treatment of recurrent lung adenocarcinoma. Radiography revealed significant reduction in all metastases; however, the patient developed progressive neuromuscular hypoventilation due to lymphocytic destruction of the diaphragmatic musculature. Serologic testing revealed a low level of de novo circulating antibodies against striated muscle fiber. Immunohistochemistry revealed type II muscle fiber atrophy with a mixed CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocyte infiltrate, indicative of inflammatory myopathy., CONCLUSIONS: This case supports the hypothesis that muscle tissue is a target for lymphocytic infiltration in immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated polymyositis. Further insights into the autoimmune mechanism of PM will hopefully contribute to the prevention and treatment of this phenomenon.

AB  - Skeletal muscle loss appears to be the most significant clinical event in cancer cachexia and is associated with a poor outcome. With regard to such muscle loss, despite extensive study in a range of models, there is ongoing debate as to whether a reduction in protein synthesis, an increase in degradation or a combination of both is the more relevant. Each model differs in terms of key mediators and the pathways activated in skeletal muscle. Certain models do suggest that decreased synthesis accompanied by enhanced protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) is important. Murine models tend to involve rapid development of cachexia and may represent more acute muscle atrophy rather than the chronic wasting observed in humans. There is a paucity of human data both at a basic descriptive level and at a molecular/mechanism level. Progress in treating the human form of cancer cachexia can only move forwards through carefully designed large randomised controlled clinical trials of specific therapies with validated biomarkers of relevance to underlying mechanisms.

AB  - A 65-year-old previously healthy male heavy smoker was hospitalized with a 2-week history of progressive muscle weakness in the lower and upper extremities. After 10 days of hospitalization, urinary sphincter incompetence and fecal incontinence were added and tetraparesis was established. The computer-tomography scan examination revealed a massive right hydrothorax and multifocal solid acinar structures with peripheral localization in the left lung, which suggested pulmonary cancer. Bone marrow metastases were also suspected. Based on the examination results, the final diagnosis was acute paraneoplastic axonal Guillain-Barre-like syndrome. The patient died 3 weeks after hospitalization. At autopsy, bronchopneumonia and a right hydrothorax were confirmed. Several 4 to 5-mm-sized round peripherally located white nodules were identified in the left lung, without any central tumor mass. Under microscope, a coin-shaped peripheral/subpleural small cell carcinoma was diagnosed, with generalized bone metastases. A huge thrombus in the abdominal aorta and acute pancreatitis was also seen at autopsy. This case highlights the difficulty of diagnosis of lung carcinomas and the necessity of a complex differential diagnosis of severe progressive ascending neuropathies. This is the 6th reported case of small cell lung cancer-associated acute Guillain-Barre-like syndrome and the first report about an association with a coin-like peripheral pattern.

AB  - We report the case of a 50-year-old female survivor of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), who developed dropped head syndrome (DHS). The patient was diagnosed with HL at 20 years of age, and underwent chemo-radiotherapy, which led to complete remission. Undergoing supplemental therapy for post-radiation hypothyroidism, she had twin babies. She noticed white stains on her neck at the age of 30, and the decolored area gradually expanded. Sixteen years after the radiotherapy (RT), her posterior neck muscle strength began to decline. She had to make considerable efforts to keep her neck straight, and came to experience a severe pain in the neck and shoulders. The patient visited our department due to DHS at the age of 50. She had leukoderma, muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy in the neck and para-spinal region, which were consistent with the area of RT. The strength was preserved in the other parts of the muscle, including the proximal upper limbs. Sensory nerve disorder was not detected. The serum creatine kinase level was slightly elevated. Cervical spine or cervical cord disease that can cause DHS was not detected by MRI examination. The MRI and CT images revealed marked atrophy in the posterior neck and para-spinal muscles. The electromyogram revealed myopathic changes, and the cause of her DHS was diagnosed as radiation-induced myopathy. DHS is a well-known late-onset radiation injury, and Japanese cases have been reported in elderly persons with laryngeal or lung cancer. However, there have been no Japanese case reports of radiation-induced DHS due to RT against HL in younger persons. The patient had visited several clinics and hospitals before she came to our hospital, but RT-induced DHS had been overlooked. Greater recognition and consideration is required for DHS as one of the various issues arising after long passage of HL survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed a reduction in the skeletal muscle area in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemotherapy. EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapies are less cytotoxic than chemotherapy, but differences in skeletal muscle mass between patients receiving EGFR and ALK TKI therapies and patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy have not yet been reported., METHODS: Data of pathologically proven NSCLC patients were reviewed, and chest computed tomography and/or positron emission tomography-computed tomography images obtained from January 2012 to December 2014 were selected. Patients were divided into two groups: cytotoxic chemotherapy (CG) and molecular targeted (MG). Muscle mass was measured with a single cross-sectional area of the muscle at the third lumber vertebra (L3MA). To estimate skeletal muscle changes during chemotherapy, we defined the following L3 skeletal muscle index (L3SMI) ratio: post L3SMI/pre L3SMI. Differences in the SMI ratio between the groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included in this study: 44 patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 21 received molecular targeted therapy (EGFR and ALK TKI). The loss of L3MA in the CG was higher than in the MG (P = 0.03). In the CG, the L3SMI ratio defined to evaluate skeletal muscle mass changes was significantly lower than in the MG (P = 0.0188)., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that skeletal muscle loss during first-line therapy was significantly different between patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and those receiving TKIs. Specifically, skeletal muscle loss was lower in patients receiving TKIs than in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - A 58-year-old man complaining of increasing weakness of muscular leg strength, diplopia and ptosis was admitted to our hospital. An electromyogram (EMG) showed typical waxing phenomenon in response to high-frequency repetitive stimulation. A diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was made from his symptoms and EMG results. A chest CT showed mediastinal lymph node swelling. No abnormal mass was seen in either lung field. His serum levels of a P/Q-type anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody, Pro-GRP, and NSE were high. FDG-PET showed accumulation of FDG to the mediastinal and left inguinal lymph nodes. The left inguinal lymphadenopathy was pathologically diagnosed as metastasis of small cell lung carcinoma. No tumor could be detected by bronchofiberscopy. No other distant metastasis was detected by brain MRI, abdominal CT, or FDG-PET. After 6 courses of chemotherapy for SCLC, a partial response and reduction of symptoms were obtained. For assessment of indistinguishable neuropathic symptoms, the possible diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome, such as LEMS, and the fact that early treatment for primary disease was effective, should be considered.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease manifested by muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous eruptions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to the beta-herpesvirinae subfamily of herpesviridae that cause morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. With respect to the relationship between CMV and DM, it remains unknown whether CMV plays a pathogenetic role or whether CMV disease is an opportunistic infection due to immunosuppressive treatment. We report two patients with DM who developed cutaneous CMV ulcers within one month after the initiation of systemic corticosteroid treatment. In this context, we retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics of six DM patients with CMV reactivation and the effect of corticosteroid treatment on CMV reactivation in these patients. We also examined possible predictive parameters of CMV reactivation during the course of DM. Our results suggest that CMV reactivation occurs more frequently in DM patients than previously recognized; CMV reactivation occurs regardless of the dosage and duration of corticosteroid administration or the presence of underlying disease. Furthermore, our study shows that a reduction in platelets, serum globulin and IgG levels during the course of DM may be useful predictive parameters for CMV reactivation in patients with DM.

AB  - We report a 64-year-old man diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Circulating anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody was detected, and the patient was treated with 3,4-diaminopyridine. At age 61, chest radiograph revealed a tumor shadow in the right upper lung field. This was surgically removed, and a histological diagnosis of moderately differentiated pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma was obtained. After about 1 year, mediastinal metastasis was detected and 5-FU was administered. Eight months later, metastasis was noted in the left frontal hemisphere, and radiosurgical therapy was performed. The brain tumor gradually shrank but generalized fatigue, thirst, and gait disturbance developed after 4 months. A diagnosis of LEMS was made on the basis of neurological findings including proximal muscle weakness and absent tendon reflexes; autonomic symptoms (thirst, constipation, and impotence); characteristic electromyographic findings; and circulating anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody. He has been treated with 3,4-diaminopyridine at a dose of 30 mg/day, resulting in marked improvement in symptoms but little change in electromyographic findings. The present case is very rare and suggests that anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody may be involved in the mechanism of LEMS associated with pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sarcopenia gradually progress with age; hence, it is necessary to define sarcopenia to predict postoperative outcomes in elderly patients with lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to propose a definition of sarcopenia in elderly patients with lung cancer, and to demonstrate the post operative outcomes., METHODS: Using computed tomography scans, the cross-sectional area (cm2) of the psoas muscle at the third lumbar vertebral level was measured. The psoas area was normalized for height. The psoas muscle mass index was calculated as total psoas muscle area at L3 level/height2 (cm2/m2)., RESULTS: A total of 173 patients aged > 75 years of age received lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer in our hospital. We defined sarcopenia as the psoas muscle mass index under 3.70 cm2/m2 in males and 2.50 cm2/m2 in females, based on the morbidity rate. The postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia (62.5%) than in those without sarcopenia (22.7%). The 5-year survival rate was 26.5% in patients with sarcopenia, and 66.3% in patients without sarcopenia., CONCLUSIONS: In elderly lung cancer patients, sarcopenia was observed to be a high risk for morbidity and predicted poor prognosis.

AB  - Transcriptional co-activator with PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (TAZ) regulates in cell proliferation and differentiation. In mesenchymal stem cells it promotes osteogenesis and myogenesis, and suppresses adipogenesis. TAZ activators are expected to prevent osteoporosis, obesity and muscle atrophy. TAZ activation induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, confers stemness to cancer cells and leads to poor clinical prognosis in cancer patients. In this point of view, TAZ inhibitors should contribute to cancer therapy. Thus, TAZ attracts attention as a two-faced drug target. We screened for TAZ modulators by using human lung cancer A549 cells expressing the fluorescent reporter. Through this assay, we obtained TAZ activator candidates. We unexpectedly found that ethacridine, a widely used antiseptic and abortifacient, enhances the interaction of TAZ and protein phosphatases and increases unphosphorylated and nuclear TAZ. Ethacridine inhibits adipogenesis in mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells through the activation of TAZ. This finding suggests that ethacridine is a bona fide TAZ activator and supports that our assay is useful to discover TAZ activators. Copyright © The Authors 2015.

AB  - PURPOSE: Currently, there is no approved therapy for cancer cachexia. According to European and American regulatory agencies, physical function improvements would be approvable co-primary endpoints of new anti-cachexia medications. As physical functioning is in part dependent on cardiac functioning, we aimed to explore the cardiac status of a group of patients meeting current criteria for inclusion in cachexia clinical trials., METHODS: Seventy treatment-naive patients with metastatic NSCLC [36 (51.4%) male; 96% ECOG 0-1; eligible for carboplatin-based therapy and meeting eligibility criteria for cachexia clinical trials] were recruited before the start of first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients were evaluated by echocardiography, electrocardiography, and scales for fatigue and dyspnea. Computed tomography cross-sectional images were utilized for body composition analysis., RESULTS: In 9/70 patients (12.8%), echocardiography allowed discovery of clinically relevant cardiac disorders [seven patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 32%-47%; one patient with severe right ventricular dilation and severe pulmonary hypertension and one patient with severe pericardial effusion warranted hospitalization and drainage]. Another 10/70 (14.3%) patients had diastolic dysfunction with preserved LVEF. The cardiac conditions were associated with aggravated fatigue (p < 0.05), dyspnea (p < 0.05), and anemia (p = 0.06). Five out of seven patients with LVEF < 50% were sarcopenic and one was borderline sarcopenic., CONCLUSION: Baseline cardiac status of the metastatic NSCLC patients adds potential heterogeneity for anti-cachexia clinical trials. Detailed cardiac screening data might be useful for inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization, and post hoc analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is a systemic catabolic condition affecting skeletal muscle and fat. We aimed to determine whether cardiac atrophy occurs in this condition and assess its association with cardiac function, symptoms, and clinical outcomes., METHODS: Treatment naive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (n = 50) were assessed prior to and 4 months after commencement of carboplatin-based palliative chemotherapy. Methods included echocardiography for left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV function [LV ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic function], computed tomography to quantify skeletal muscle and total adipose tissue, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), validated questionnaires for dyspnoea and fatigue, plasma biomarkers, tumour response to therapy, and overall survival., RESULTS: During 112 +/- 6 days, the median change in LVM was -8.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -10.8 to -4.8, P < 0.001]. Quartiles of LVM loss were -20.1%, -12.9%, -4.8%, and +5.5%. Losses of muscle, adipose tissue, and LVM were frequently concurrent; LVM loss > median value was associated with loss of skeletal muscle [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-14.8, P=0.01] and loss of total adipose tissue (OR = 10.0, 95% CI: 2.7-36.7, P < 0.001). LVM loss was associated with decreased GLS (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9-22.7, P=0.003) but not with LV ejection fraction or diastolic function. In the population overall, plasma levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.008), high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) (P=0.03), and galectin-3 (P=0.02) increased over time, while N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and hs-cTnI did not change over time. C-reactive protein was the only biomarker associated with LVM loss but at the univariate level only. Independent predictors of LVM loss were prior weight loss (adjusted OR = 10.2, 95% CI: 2.2-46.9, P=0.003) and tumour progression (adjusted OR = 14.6, 95% CI: 1.4-153.9, P=0.02). LVM loss was associated with exacerbations of fatigue (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9-22.7, P=0.003), dyspnoea (OR = 9.3, 95% CI: 2.4-35.8, P<0.001), and deterioration of performance status (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-18.3,P=0.02). Patients with concurrent loss of LVM, skeletal muscle, and fat were more likely to deteriorate in all three symptom domains and to have reduced survival (P=0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Intense LVM atrophy is associated with non-small cell lung cancer-induced cachexia. Loss of LVM was associated with emerging alterations of GLS, indicating subtle changes in left ventricular function. Longer term studies are needed to assess the full scope of cardiac atrophy and its impact. LVM atrophy arises in conjunction with losses of fat and skeletal muscle and is temporally associated with meaningful declines in performance status, worsening of fatigue, and dyspnoea, as well as poorer tumour response and decreased survival. The specific contribution of LVM atrophy to these outcomes requires further study.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Thoracic malignancies are amongst the most lethal of all cancers. Cancer cachexia lacks unanimously accepted diagnostic criteria, and therefore is referenced to as a conceptual framework whereby cancer cachexia is 'an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (termed sarcopenia), with or without loss of fat mass that cannot be reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment'. This review summarises the current evidence base in this field, including imaging techniques currently used to define sarcopenia, inflammatory and metabolic changes associated with the syndrome and ongoing research into potential treatment strategies., RECENT FINDINGS: Sarcopenia is a key component of the cancer cachexia syndrome. It is common in patients with both early-stage and advanced NSCLC. Patients with sarcopenia have more treatment-related side effects and poorer overall survival compared with nonsarcopenic patients., SUMMARY: Early identification of cancer cachexia may facilitate stratification of patients most-at-risk and initiation of emerging anticachexia treatments. If these are proven to be effective, this strategy has the potential to improve tolerance to anti-cancer therapies, improving the quality of life, and perhaps the survival, of patients with thoracic malignancies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although exertional fatigue is directly and negatively related to skeletal muscle mass and strength, it is currently unknown if these variables are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if CRF is associated with measures of appendicular lean muscle mass and strength in advanced cancer patients (ACP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (48 men, 36 women aged 61.6 +/- 13.2 year) newly diagnosed (<=6 months) with inoperable (Stages III-IV) gastrointestinal or non-small cell lung cancer participated in this study. All patients completed the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Handgrip (HGS) and quadriceps (QS) strength were assessed using isometric and isokinetic dynamometry, respectively. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was calculated from the appendicular lean mass measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry divided by body height squared. Univariate analysis showed BFI to be significantly associated with body mass index, weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, activity level, pain, depression, and sarcopenia along with SMMI, HGS, and QS. HGS (r = -0.34; p = 0.018), QS (r = -0.39; p = 0.024), and SMMI (r = -0.60; p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with BFI total scores in men but not in women. When adjusted for sex, age, diagnosis, survival, along with the above characteristics, multivariate analyses showed that BFI scores were negatively associated with HGS (B = -0.90; 95% CI -1.5:-0.3), QS (-0.2; -0.3:-0.01), and SMMI (-7.5; -13.0:-2.0). There was a significant sex x SMMI interaction (10.8; 1.2:20.5), where BFI decreased with increasing SMMI in men, but did not change with SMMI in women. CONCLUSION : These results suggest that in ACP, CRF is related to muscle mass and strength, which may provide targets for future interventions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Handgrip strength (HGS) has been shown to predict survival and is associated with changes in body composition, nutritional status, inflammation, and functional ability in several chronic disease conditions. Whether similar relationships exist between HGS and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced cancer are currently unknown. We evaluated the association between HGS and survival as well as several key markers of body composition (e.g., sarcopenia), subjective performance measures (e.g., quality of life), and muscle strength (e.g., isokinetic torque of the quadriceps) in patients with advanced forms of non-small cell lung and gastrointestinal cancers., METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 203 patients with advanced cancer was enrolled and categorized into three HGS percentiles (e.g., >=50th, 25th, and <=10th) according to published normative values. Multivariate regression analyses were used to test for independent associations between HGS and survival, sarcopenia, quality of life (QoL), and lower extremity muscle strength as well as key biological markers (e.g., hemoglobin, albumin, and C-reactive protein) while controlling for age, gender, cancer diagnosis, treatment (chemotherapy/radiotherapy), medications, and time from diagnosis to assessment., RESULTS: When compared to HGS >=50th, patients in the HGS <=10th percentile had lower BMI (B, -2.5 kg/m(2); 95% CI, -4.5 to -0.45), shorter survival (hazard ratio, 3.2; 2.0-5.1), lower hemoglobin (-19.70 g/L; -27.28 to -12.13) and albumin (-4.99 g/L; -7.85 to -2.13), greater occurrence of sarcopenia (odds ratio, 9.53; 1.95-46.55), lower isokinetic torque of the quadriceps at both 60degree/s (-30.6 Nm; -57.9 to -3.3) and 120degree/s (-25.1 Nm; -46.4 to -3.7), lower QoL (-1.6 on McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire scale; -2.5 to -0.6), higher levels of fatigue (18.8 on Brief Fatigue Inventory scale; 4.7 -32.9), poorer performance status (0.75 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status scale; 0.34-1.15), lower fat mass (-7.4 kg; -14.4 to -0.5), and lower lean body mass (-6.5 kg; -10.3 to -2.8)., CONCLUSIONS: HGS is independently associated with survival and important biological, functional, and quality of life characteristics in advanced cancer patients. Patients presenting with very low percentiles with respect to their handgrip assessment may require timely referral to supportive and/or palliative care services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is prevalent and a known adverse prognostic effector in lung cancer (LCA). However, the relationship between sarcopenia and histology remains uncertain in LCA., METHODS: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed LCA (n = 778) between June 2012 and February 2015 were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was defined as CT-determined L3 muscle index (muscle area at L3/height2) of < 55 cm2/m2 for men and < 39 cm2/m2 for women., RESULTS: Mean patient age was 67.7 +/- 10.8 years, and most (73.1%) were male. The most prevalent histology was adenocarcinoma (44.0%) and 71.6% of patients had stage III or IV disease. The overall prevalence of sarcopenia was 48.2% (60.3% in men, and 15.3% in women). Univariable analysis showed sarcopenia was significantly associated with male gender, age (>= 65 years), smoking status, lower BMI (< 23 kg/m2), advanced stage (III and IV), and high comorbidity score (Charlson index >= 3). Furthermore, the prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in squamous cell carcinoma (54.9%) and small cell LCA (56.4%) than in adenocarcinoma (39.8%). Multivariable analyses showed sarcopenia was independently associated with a male gender (odds ratio [OR], 11.13), elderly (OR, 2.02) and low BMI (OR, 6.28), stage IV (OR, 1.98), and high comorbidity (OR, 1.93). However, no significant association was found between histologic subtypes and sarcopenia., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia was found to be significantly associated with old age, male gender, an advanced stage, comorbidities, and low BMI in LCA. However, histology subtype was not an independent factor for the presence of sarcopenia.

AB  - Using a representative dataset from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2008 to 2011, we analyzed anthropometric and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-determined body composition findings for 493 cancer survivors (mean age a61.1 +/- 12.6 years; 35.7% male). A much higher proportion of men (30.1%) than women (0.6%) met the criteria of sarcopenia. Subjects with a history of lung cancer, genitourinary cancer, or gastric cancer were prone to develop sarcopenia (31.6%, 26.3%, and 21.4%, respectively). Furthermore, sarcopenia was more prevalent among elderly (>=65 years; P < 0.001), those with a lower BMI level (<23 kg/m2; P < 0.001), heavy drinker (P = 0.012), or smoker (P < 0.001), and those with inadequate intakes of protein (P = 0.017) and vitamin A (P = 0.024). Multivariable logistic analyses revealed sarcopenia was significantly associated with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 68.14; 95% CI, 15.52-299.13), a BMI of <23 kg/m2 (OR 35.93, 95% CI, 8.24-156.67), and inadequate protein intake (OR 3.07, 95% CI, 1.30-7.22); these factors are significant predictors of sarcopenia in Korean cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single cross-sectional area of muscle at the third lumbar vertebra (L3MA) is gold standard to estimate skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and L3 muscle index (L3MI, L3MA/height(2)) is used to determine sarcopenia. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the relationship between SMM indices determined by routine chest CT and L3MI in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and to suggest chest CT-derived diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia., METHODS: Area of pectoralis muscles at the aortic arch (PMA) and at L1 (L1MA) was retrospectively measured on chest CT images of 90 consecutive SCLC patients. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to assess relationships between L3MI determined by PET/CT and pectoralis muscle index (PMI) and L1 muscle index (L1MI) determined by chest CT., RESULTS: The correlation between L1MI and L3MI was stronger than that between PMI and L3MI (r = 0.851 vs. r = 0.447, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that L1MI was the only significant predictor of L3MI; L3MI = 0.963 x L1MI + 10.336 (R (2) = 0.689, p < 0.001) for male and L3MI = 0.772 x L1MI + 16.518 (R (2) = 0.777, p < 0.001) for female. Using this relationship, estimated cutoffs of L1MI for sarcopenia were 46 cm(2)/m(2) for male and 29 cm(2)/m(2) for female (L3MI cutoffs for sarcopenia are 55 cm(2)/m(2) for male and 39 cm(2)/m(2) for female). The sensitivity and specificity of L1MI cutoffs to determine sarcopenia were 98.2 and 100 %, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT-determined L1MI is highly correlated with L3MI in SCLC patients. L1MI, as determined by chest CT, could be used to determine the presence of sarcopenia with suggested cutoffs of 46 cm(2)/m(2) for men and 29 cm(2)/m(2) for women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of sarcopenia, an important component of cancer cachexia, has been demonstrated in oncologic patients. Catabolic drivers have been suggested to be key features of cancer cachexia., OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between systemic inflammatory markers and CT-determined muscle mass in patients with SCLC., METHODS: Cross-sectional muscle areas were evaluated at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) using baseline CT images in 186 SCLC patients. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 muscle index (L3MI, muscle area at L3/height2) of < 55 cm2/m2 for men and of < 39 cm2/m2 for women. Systemic inflammatory markers investigated included serum white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and albumin., RESULTS: Mean L3MI was 47.9 +/- 9.7 cm2/m2 for men and 41.6 +/- 7.0 cm2/m2 for women. Sarcopenia was present in 128 patients (68.8%), and sarcopenic patients had significant serum lymphocyte counts and albumin levels (p = 0.002 and 0.041, respectively), and higher NLRs and CRP levels (p = 0.011 and 0.026) than non-sarcopenic patients. Multivariable analysis revealed that CRP independently predicted L3MI (beta = -0.208; 95% CI, -0.415 to -0.002; p = 0.048), along with gender and BMI (p values < 0.001) and performance status (p = 0.010)., CONCLUSION: The present study confirms a significant linear relationship exists between CT-determined muscle mass and CRP in SCLC patients. This association might provide a better understanding of the mechanism of cancer cachexia.

AB  - To determine the prognostic significance of CT-determined cachexia scores (CSs) in 127 consecutive male small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, cross-sectional areas of muscle and fat tissues at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) were retrospectively measured on baseline CT images. CSs were determined based on the presence of sarcopenia and/or adipopenia. According to the presence of sarcopenia (L3 muscle index <55 cm2 /m2 , 86.8%) and adipopenia (L3 fat index <22 cm2 /m2 , 11.8%), CSs were defined as follows: CS2 (sarcopenia and adipopenia, 11.8%), CS1 (sarcopenia only, 74.8%) and CS0 (13.4%). CS2 was significantly related to lower body mass index (p < .001) and poor performance status (p = .002), and patients with CS2 had shorter OS than patients with CS1 or CS0 (median OS, 5.0 months vs. 8.9 months vs. 18.3 months; p = .007). Multivariable analysis revealed that CS was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (HR, 1.99 for CS1 and 2.59 for CS2, p = .036 and .023, CS0 as a reference), along with extensive stage (p < .001), supportive care only (p < .001) and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (p = .005). CT-determined CSs, based on the presence of sarcopenia and/or adipopenia, could be used to predict prognosis in male SCLC. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Here, we report a case of myasthenia gravis and myopathy in a patient treated with nivolumab. A 76-year-old man who had been treated with four doses of nivolumab because of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented with proximal-dominant muscle weakness and fluctuating ptosis and diplopia. Serologic studies revealed increased levels of muscle enzymes including creatine phosphokinase (2934 U/L), and acetylcholine receptor antibody was positive (1.31 nmol/L). Following electrodiagnostic study, he was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis and active stage of myopathy. After discontinuation of nivolumab, he was treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and pyridostigmine. The neuromuscular symptoms and serologic abnormalities of the patient markedly improved. Currently, he is taking oral steroids and pyridostigmine without further immunotherapy.

AB  - Sarcopenia is frequently associated with chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer. COPD, which is characterized by an irreversible airflow limitation, exacerbates respiratory distress as the disease progresses. The prevalence of sarcopenia in stable COPD was reported to be 15% to 25% in previous foreign studies and 25% in a Korean study. As the amount of activity decreases, muscle mass decreases and eventually oxygen cannot be used effectively, resulting in a vicious cycle of deterioration of exercise capacity. Deconditioning due to decreased activity is a major cause of limb muscle dysfunction in patients with COPD. In these patients, the factors that decrease muscle strength and endurance include chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, inactivity, hypoxemia, hormone abnormality, deficits of nutrients such as protein and vitamin D, and the use of systemic corticosteroid. Therefore, treatment and management should either inhibit this process or should be directed toward supplementing the deficiency, such as with exercise, nutritional support, and medications and supplements. The relationship between sarcopenia and COPD is increasingly being reported, with some overlap in clinical features and treatments. We are fascinated to be able to diagnose 2 diseases through similar physical performance tests and to improve both diseases using the same treatment such as exercise. Therefore, this review summarizes the clinical relevance and integrative management of the 2 diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting is a component of the diagnosis of cancer cachexia and has been associated with poor prognosis. However, recommended tools to measure sarcopenia are limited by poor sensitivity or the need to perform additional scans. We hypothesized that pectoralis muscle area (PMA) measured objectively on chest CT scan may be associated with overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: We evaluated 252 cases from a prospectively enrolling lung cancer cohort. Eligible cases had CT scans performed prior to the initiation of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. PMA was measured in a semi-automated fashion while blinded to characteristics of the tumor, lung, and patient outcomes., RESULTS: Men had a significantly greater PMA than women (37.59 vs. 26.19 cm2, P < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, PMA was associated with age and body mass index (BMI). A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to account for confounders associated with survival. Lower pectoralis area (per cm2) at diagnosis was associated with an increased hazard of death of 2% (HRadj, 0.98; confidence interval, 0.96-0.99; P = 0.044) while adjusting for age, sex, smoking, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, histology, stage, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, BMI, and ECOG performance status., CONCLUSIONS: Lower PMA measured from chest CT scans obtained at the time of diagnosis of NSCLC is associated with a worse OS., IMPACT: PMA may be a valuable CT biomarker for sarcopenia-associated lung cancer survival.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Muscle wasting has detrimental effects, including increased mortality. Identifying patients at risk can guide treatment efforts., METHODS: POWER 1 and 2 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase III trials that studied 600 patients with lung cancer at the start of chemotherapy; the studies' aim was to assess the efficacy of enobosarm on prevention and treatment of muscle loss. We performed a secondary analysis restricted to the control group, using a cumulative logit model for ordinal outcome to determine which baseline characteristics predicted physical and functional loss during chemotherapy., RESULTS: In all, 53% of patients had loss of lean body mass and 49% had loss of stair climb power (SCP) at day 84 of treatment. Of the 322 patients who received placebo, 232 with observable outcome and baseline covariates were included for lean body mass analysis and 236 for SCP analysis. More advanced disease predicted a higher probability of greater physical loss (OR = 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.36). Three factors predicted higher probability of SCP loss: taxane chemotherapy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.83), tobacco use before chemotherapy (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.10-4.18), and SCP at baseline (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.004-1.015). Higher body mass index was a protective factor for functional loss (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). A higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status trended toward being predictive of greater probability of both physical loss (0.767) and functional loss (0.070), but the results were not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy had ongoing loss of muscle mass and muscle function. Advanced stage predicted physical loss. Tobacco use and taxane chemotherapy predicted functional loss. Body mass index was a protective factor for functional loss. We identified predictors of physical and functional loss that could be used as therapeutic targets or to guide treatment efforts.

AB  - Cachexia is a wasting disorder of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues that leads to profound weight loss and frailty. About half of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia, which impairs quality of life, limits cancer therapy and decreases survival. One key characteristic of cachexia is higher resting energy expenditure levels than in healthy individuals, which has been linked to greater thermogenesis by brown fat. How tumours induce brown fat activity is unknown. Here, using a Lewis lung carcinoma model of cancer cachexia, we show that tumour-derived parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has an important role in wasting, through driving the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis in adipose tissues. Neutralization of PTHrP in tumour-bearing mice blocked adipose tissue browning and the loss of muscle mass and strength. Our results demonstrate that PTHrP mediates energy wasting in fat tissues and contributes to the broader aspects of cancer cachexia. Thus, neutralization of PTHrP might hold promise for ameliorating cancer cachexia and improving patient survival.

AB  - Pancoast syndrome, classically considered as a constellation of (1) pain along the C8-T2 dermatomes, (2) weakness and atrophy of the hand and (3) Horner's syndrome, often presents a diagnostic challenge. In fact, it may manifest as a singular orthopaedic complaint, prompting a futile barrage of tests and referrals. The authors present the case of an elderly man who initially presented with severe shoulder pain. Due to progressive pain and weakness, he was referred to rheumatology and was treated with corticosteroid injections for a presumed musculoskeletal lesion. Ultimately, he manifested gross muscular atrophy and worsening pain, prompting a referral to neurology. An electromyogram (EMG) suggested a lower brachial plexopathy, and a follow-up brachial plexus MRI identified a large Pancoast tumour. Unfortunately, his disease was rapidly progressive, and he passed away within 2&emsp14;months. While the MRI remains the gold standard for diagnosing Pancoast syndrome, an EMG can facilitate diagnosis in difficult cases such as this one.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sarcopenia is associated with reduced survival in cancer. Currently, data on sarcopenia at presentation and muscle loss throughout treatment are unknown in patients receiving chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluated skeletal muscle changes in NSCLC patients receiving CRT and relationship with survival., METHODS: Secondary analysis of 41 patients with NSCLC treated with CRT assessed for skeletal muscle area and muscle density by computed tomography pre-treatment and 3 months post-treatment. Images at week 4 of treatment were available for 32 (78%) patients. Linear mixed models were applied to determine changes in skeletal muscle over time and related to overall survival using Kaplan-Meier plots., RESULTS: Muscle area and muscle density decreased significantly by week 4 of CRT (- 6.6 cm2, 95% CI - 9.7 to - 3.1, p < 0.001; - 1.3 HU, 95% CI - 1.9 to - 0.64, p < 0.001, respectively), with minimal change between week 4 of CRT and 3 months post-CRT follow-up (- 0.2 cm2, 95% CI - 3.6-3.1, p = 0.91; - 0.27, 95% CI - 0.91-0.36, p = 0.36, respectively). Sarcopenia was present in 25 (61%) and sarcopenic obesity in 6 (14%) of patients prior to CRT, but not associated with poorer survival. Median survival was shorter in patients with low muscle density prior to treatment although not statistically significant (25 months + 8.3 vs 53 months + 13.0, log-rank p = 0.17)., CONCLUSION: Significant loss of muscle area and muscle density occurs in NSCLC patients early during CRT. A high proportion of patients are sarcopenic prior to CRT; however, this was not significantly associated with poorer survival.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction. Approximately 50-60% of patients with LEMS have a tumor, most often small cell lung cancer (SCLC), making LEMS a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. In Japan, the clinical picture is a male: female ratio of 3:1; mean age, 62 years (17-80 years); and 61% of LEMS patients have SCLC (SCLC-LEMS), with the remainder of patients having no cancer. Patients with LEMS develop a unique set of clinical characteristics, which include proximal muscle weakness, depressed tendon reflexes with post-tetanic potentiation, and autonomic symptoms. Interestingly, less than 10% of patients with LEMS have cerebellar ataxia (LEMS with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration). Considering its pathomechanisms, LEMS is a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission in which quantal release of acetylcholine is impaired by autoantibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (P/Q-VGCCs) at active zones reducing quantal release of acetylcholine, although an animal model using immunization with purified P/Q-VGCCs has not yet been established. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding a reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude that increases by over 60% following maximum voluntary activation or 50 Hz nerve stimulation. Approximately 90% of patients who satisfy the above electrophysiological diagnostic criteria are positive for P/Q-VGCC antibodies have their diagnosis confirmed. Specific tumor therapy in SCLC-LEMS will often improve the neurologic deficit. Tumor removal is the primary treatment for LEMS. If primary tumor screening is negative, screening should be repeated after 3-6 months, followed by screening every 6 months until 2 years post diagnosis. Most patients benefit from 3,4-diaminopyridine being administered with pyridostigmine. In those with severe weakness, high-dose intravenous gamma-globulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis confers short-term benefits. Prednisone, alone or combined with immunosuppressive drugs, can achieve long-term control of the disorder. The results of a prospective cohort study showed that the presence of LEMS with SCLC had a significant survival advantage independent of other prognostic factors including disease extent, age, sex, performance status, and serum sodium values.

AB  - From January 1975 to December 1986, 415 patients were operated for primary lung cancer. Postoperative pulmonary complications were observed in 83 patients and among them 48 patients (57.8%) suffered from difficulty in expectoration. Postoperative expectoration mostly depends on the ability of coughing. To evaluate cough dynamics, expiratory flow-rate and volume at voluntary maximal cough were measured. The more expiratory flow rate and volume a cough has, the more effective it is for expectoration. In those patients with decreased FEV1.0, or respiratory muscle weakness because of emaciation and aging, or severe pain in the wound, the cough dynamics was decreased. By cleaning retained secretions in the respiratory tract, postoperative pulmonary complications would be prevented. However in cases where the decrease in postoperative cough dynamics is predictable, application of limited resection should be considered as well.

AB  - Even though most clinical data on cachexia have been reported from Western countries, cachexia may be a growing problem in Asia as well, as the population in this area of the world is considerably larger. Considering the current definitions of obesity and sarcopenia in Japan, which are different from the ones in Western countries, the lack of a distinct cachexia definition in Japan is strinking. Only one epidemiological study has reported the prevalence of cachexia using weight loss as part of the definition in patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Although the reported prevalence of 45.6% is within the range of that in Western countries (28-57% in advanced cancer), we cannot compare the prevalence of cachexia in other types of cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and kidney disease (CKD) between Japan and Western countries. In patients with heart failure, one third of Japanese patients has a body mass index <20.3 kg/m2 whereas the prevalence of underweight is 13.6% in reports from Western countries. These results may suggest that there are more cachectic heart failure patients in Japan, or that using the same definition like Western countries leads to gross overestimation of the prevalence of cachexia in Japan. The rate of underweight patients in COPD has been reported as 31-41% in COPD and seems to be high in comparison to the prevalence of cachexia in Western countries (27-35%). The reported lowest quartile value of BMI (19.6 kg/m2) in CKD may match with the prevalence of cachexia in Western countries (30-60%). The number of clinical trials targeting cachexia is very limited in Japan so far.

AB  - We describe the case of a 56-year-old man with severe muscle weakness due to heavy hypokalemia (serum potassium 1.44 mmol/l) associated with inappropriate kaliuria and alkalemia. Subsequent investigation revealed the presence of ectopic ACTH hypersecretion due to a small-cell lung carcinoma. A significant clinical/laboratory improvement was achieved following chemotherapy-induced regression of the primary tumor. The profound hypokalemia was probably the result of cortisol hypersecretion, which in concert with the ACTH-induced decreased 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity can exhibit an increased mineralocorticoid activity. In addition, other ACTH-dependent mineralocorticoids may play a contributory role in the development of severe hypokalemia.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective multi-institutional study was to evaluate the nutritional status of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for treatment of head and neck, lung, or gastrointestinal cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,000 patients were enrolled in this study at seven different hospitals in Seoul, Korea between October 2009 and May 2010. The nutritional status of patients after receiving 3 weeks of RT was evaluated using subjective global assessment (SGA). The nutritional status of each patient was rated as well nourished (A), moderately malnourished (B), or severely malnourished (C)., RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this study was 59.4 +/- 11.9 years, and the male to female ratio was 7:3. According to the SGA results, 60.8%, 34.5%, and 4.7% of patients were classified as A, B, or C, respectively. The following criteria were significantly associated with malnutrition (SGA B or C; p < 0.001): loss of subcutaneous fat or muscle wasting (odds ratio [OR], 11.473); increased metabolic demand/stress (OR, 8.688); ankle, sacral edema, or ascites (OR, 3.234); and weight loss >=5% (OR, 2.299)., CONCLUSION: SGA was applied successfully to assess the nutritional status of most patients. The prevalence of malnutrition in a radiation oncology department was 39.2%. The results of this study serve as a basis for implementation of nutrition intervention to patients being treated at radiation oncology departments.

AB  - Lung cancer belongs to the type of tumors with a relatively high frequency of malnutrition, sarcopenia and cachexia, severe metabolic syndromes related to impairment of physical function and quality of life, resistance to therapy and short survival. Inexpensive and accessible methods of evaluating changes in body composition, physical function and nutrition status are for this reason of great importance for clinical practice to enable the early identification, monitoring, preventing and treatment of these nutritional deficiencies. This could lead to improved outcomes in the quality of life, physical performance and survival of patients with lung cancer. The aim of this article is to summarize the recent knowledge for the use of such methods, their predictability for patient outcomes and an association with other clinically relevant parameters, specifically with lung cancer patients, because such an article collectively describing their practical application in clinical practice is lacking. The interest of this article is in the use of anthropometry, handgrip dynamometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis derived phase angle and nutritional screening questionnaires in lung cancer patients.

AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 75-year-old woman was admitted because of weakness and paraesthesias in both legs. 15 years earlier a chest radiogram had shown numerous round foci of uncertain cause. Physical examination confirmed muscular weakness in all limbs, especially the legs, as well as abnormal superficial and deep sensory perception., INVESTIGATIONS: Electromyography registered a patchy pattern of intentional muscular activity and marked denervation activity but largely normal nerve conduction. There was no evidence of inflammatory disease in the laboratory tests, including the CNS. DIAGNOSIS, COURSE AND TREATMENT: The neurological findings indicated progressive axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. A paraneoplastic cause was suspected, but search for a primary tumour was unsuccessful. The patient developed a urinary infection from which she died in septic shock. A carcinoid-like well-differentiated carcinoma of the breast with hematogenous metastases to liver, spleen and lung was discovered at autopsy. It also revealed severe systemic AA-type amyloidosis, involving liver, spleen heart and kidneys. In addition there was a severe progressive axonal neuropathy and marked neurogenic atrophy of the peripheral skeletal musculature. No amyloid deposition was seen., CONCLUSION: In case of amyloidosis and polyneuropathy of uncertain cause a paraneoplastic pathogenesis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even in the absence of proven malignancy.

AB  - A 69-year-old man with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma received durvalumab following chemoradiotherapy. The prescribed dose was 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, and the maximum spinal cord dose was 40 Gy. After three cycles of durvalumab, he experienced bladder and rectal disturbance, muscle weakness in the lower limbs, and sensory loss in the lower body. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2 signal hyperintensity involving the thoracic spinal cord. As the thoracic spinal cord with T2 signal hyperintensity matched with the irradiated site, the patient was diagnosed with radiation myelitis. This case report shows the clinical and radiographic features of a case of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer that demonstrated radiation myelitis following durvalumab administration. The time of onset was very early and the influence of durvalumab was suspected as the cause of myelitis.

AB  - We herein report a 42-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and nivolumab-associated dermatomyositis. Nivolumab, an anticancer drug that is classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, often induces immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, there have so far been no reports regarding nivolumab-associated dermatomyositis. This patient was diagnosed with dermatomyositis due to the presence of proximal muscle weakness with abnormal electromyography and magnetic resonance imaging findings; skin lesions, such as heliotrope rash, shawl sign, and periungual erythema; and an elevated serum aldolase level after nivolumab administration. It is important to consider drug-associated dermatomyositis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with skin lesions and muscle weakness after nivolumab treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), a variant of spinocerebellar degeneration (Shy-Drager syndrome), is a systemic degenerative disorder affecting the neurons of multiple nuclei. We investigated the sensitivity to vecuronium and the pupillary responses to various stresses in a patient with OPCA., CLINICAL FEATURES: A 65-yr-old woman with a six-month history of OPCA underwent a left upper lobectomy for lung cancer under propofol-N2O anaesthesia. She had symptoms of dysarthria, bulbar palsy, cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, myosis, pyramidal signs and muscular atrophy of the distal extremities. A cumulative dose-response curve for vecuronium was constructed, and pupillary changes in response to various noxious stimuli were evaluated with concomitant recording of the Spectral-Edge-Frequency 90% (SEF90; the frequency below which 90 percent of the EEG power is located). The dose-response curve for vecuronium and the estimated ED50 value (the 50% blocking dose of vecuronium) in this patient with OPCA were almost identical with those of five ASA I-II patients (27 micrograms.kg-1 vs 31 micrograms.kg-1). The pupil size and the SEF90 did not change after tracheal intubation or surgical stimulation in this patient, while in the control subjects (n = 3), these measures increased in response to both stresses., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of pupillary and SEF90 responses to noxious stimuli suggests a sensitivity to propofol and/or central autonomic dysfunction in patients with OPCA. Although the dose requirement of vecuronium in this patient was similar to that of the control patients, the effects of neuromuscular blockers may vary depending on the severity of muscle atrophy.

AB  - We present the first case of small cell lung cancer with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome during hemodialysis (HD). A 72-year-old male patient receiving HD experienced progressive muscle weakness. He was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome due to an increased serum level of anti-voltage-gated calcium channel antibody and aspiration cytology on endobronchial ultrasonography for the swelling of a subcarinal lymph node. He received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin (300 mg/m(2)) and etoposide (50 mg/m(2)), to which he had a partial response. However, the second therapy course could not be administered because of the unexpected development of severe hematological adverse events, which also prevented him from undergoing further HD. This case indicates that caution should be taken when using chemotherapy for such patients because of hypotension due to chemotherapy, with which it is impossible to undergo HD.

AB  - The purpose of this study is (1) to evaluate skeletal muscle magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) during treatment with cisplatin; (2) to evaluate the predictive value of plasma (P)-Mg for intracellular Mg during cisplatin treatment; and (3) to evaluate whether changes in intracellular K influence skeletal muscle Na,K-ATPase. In all, 65 patients had a needle muscle biopsy obtained before and 26 patients both before and after cisplatin treatment. Biopsies were analysed for Mg, K, and Na,K-ATPase concentrations, and P-Mg and P-K determined. Treatment with a total dose of approximately 500 mg (270 mg m(-2) surface area) cisplatin over 80 days was associated with reductions in muscle [Mg] (95% CI) (8.95 (8.23-9.63) to 7.76 (7.34-8.18) mumol g(-1) wet wt. (P<0.01), and muscle [K] (90.81 (83.29-98.34) to 82.87 (78.74-87.00) mumol g(-1) wet wt. (P<0.05), as well as in P-Mg 0.82 (0.80-0.85) to 0.68 (0.64-0.73) mmol l(-1) (P<0.01 but not in P-K (4.0 (3.8-4.1) vs 3.8 (3.7-4.0) mmol l(-1)). No simple correlations were observed between P-Mg and muscle [Mg], or between P-K and muscle [K], either before (n=65) or after (n=26) treatment with cisplatin. The changes in [Mg] and [K] were not associated with changes in the muscle Na,K-ATPase concentration. Following treatment with cisplatin, an approximately 15% decline in P-Mg was accompanied by an approximately 15% loss of muscle [Mg], as well as an approximately 10% reduction of muscle [K] and fatigue and muscle weakness previously ascribed to hypomagnesaemia may therefore also be well explained by muscle K depletion observed despite normal levels of P-K. There was no correlation between P-Mg and SM-Mg or between P-K and SM-K. Thus, P-Mg and P-K are not reliable indicators for Mg and K depletion during treatment with cisplatin. However, the majority of patients will present Mg and K depletion after cisplatin therapy and of these only very few patients will present a low P-Mg or P-K. Therefore, routine supplementation should be considered in all patients receiving cisplatin.

AB  - Respiratory muscle function was assessed in six patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Five had histologically proved small cell carcinoma of the lung; the sixth later developed metastases from an unknown primary site. Two patients had ventilatory failure, one without respiratory symptoms; another, who had emphysema, had dyspnoea and orthopnoea. The remaining three patients had no respiratory symptoms. Four patients had limb muscle weakness as judged by the maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps muscle (range for all subjects 32-100% predicted). Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was measured during a maximal unoccluded sniff (Pdi: sniff), a maximal sustained inspiratory effort against a closed airway (Pdi: Pimax), and phrenic nerve stimulation (Pdi: twitch). Mild to moderate diaphragmatic weakness was present in all six patients in proportion to the degree of leg weakness (Pdi: sniff 30-64% predicted; r = 0.6; Pdi:Pimax 6-69% predicted, r = 0.8); this was associated with very low or absent Pdi:twitch during phrenic nerve stimulation. Four patients had weakness of the expiratory muscles. Improvement in muscle strength was documented in two patients after tumour chemotherapy and specific treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine and prednisolone; one patient was still alive five years from first diagnosis. It is concluded that the respiratory muscles may be implicated in this condition more often than has previously been recognised. As the lack of mobility may cause respiratory symptoms to be minimised, the presence of respiratory muscle weakness may remain undiagnosed unless formal measurement of respiratory muscle function is made.

Denosumab is indicated to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs) from osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease. We report a case of denosumab-induced hypocalcemia to highlight potential toxicity and treatment considerations. A 66-year-old man with prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and bone metastases presented with fatigue, weakness, and muscle spasm. Sixteen days prior, he received cycle 6 of cisplatin and etoposide, leuprolide, and denosumab (120 mg subcutaneously). His examination demonstrated a slight resting tremor, normal strength, and negative Chvostek sign. Laboratory analysis revealed hemoglobin, 8.0 g/dL; total calcium, 5.2 mg/dL (pre-denosumab, 8.9 mg/dL); and magnesium, 0.7 mg/dL. He initially received two units packed red blood cells, intravenous calcium and magnesium, and vitamin D. During his hospitalization, he required multiple doses of intravenous and oral calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Despite ongoing oral supplementation, his post-discharge serum calcium fluctuated significantly, requiring close monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. Denosumab's unique antiresorptive properties yield fewer SREs. The trade-off is increased hypocalcemia risk, which may be severe and require aggressive, prolonged supplementation and monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cancer cachexia is characterised by a progressive loss of muscle, resulting in functional impairment and shorter survival. Therefore, omega-3 has been studied for its role as an anti-cachectic therapy. This systematic review identified studies published on use of omega-3 in cancer cachexia in order to examine the potential benefit., METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using PubMed and B-on databases was conducted to identify clinical trials published between 2000 and 2015, to evaluate the effect of n-3 PUFAs on nutritional features and Quality of Life in cancer cachexia. Of 140 publications, 7 were selected on the basis of their methodological quality, according to the Delphi List. The collected data was summarized and written in text format and in tables., RESULTS: Only one study, made in pre-cachectic population, show statistically and clinically positive intervention. No benefits were observed with the 4 g EPA/day, but a potentially clinically relevant treatment effect with 2 g EPA/day. Lung tumours showed the highest CRP levels and while the weight of patients with gastrointestinal cancer increased significantly, patients with lung cancer showed no significant response., CONCLUSIONS: Future cachexia trials would likely benefit from studying a single tumour type with earlier stage disease, with probably different dosage depending on the cancer type and its inflammatory profile.

AB  - Muscle atrophy is a hallmark of cancer cachexia resulting in impaired function and quality of life and cachexia is the immediate cause of death for 20-40% of cancer patients. Multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as being involved in muscle development and atrophy; however, less is known specifically on miRNAs in cancer cachexia. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the miRNA profile of skeletal muscle atrophy induced by cancer cachexia to uncover potential miRNAs involved with this catabolic condition. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC) were injected into C57BL/6J mice at 8 wk of age. LLC animals were allowed to develop tumors for 4 wk to induce cachexia. Tibialis anterior muscles were extracted and processed to isolate small RNAs, which were used for miRNA sequencing. Sequencing results were assembled with mature miRNAs, and functions of miRNAs were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. LLC animals developed tumors that contributed to significantly smaller tibialis anterior muscles (18.5%) and muscle cross-sectional area (40%) compared with PBS. We found 371 miRNAs to be present in the muscle above background levels. Of these, nine miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. Significantly altered groups of miRNAs were categorized into primary functionalities including cancer, cell-to-cell signaling, and cellular development among others. Gene network analysis predicted specific alterations of factors contributing to muscle size including Akt, FOXO3, and others. These results create a foundation for future research into the sufficiency of targeting these genes to attenuate muscle loss in cancer cachexia. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy, of unknown etiology, which is characterized by cutaneous rashes, accompanied by progressive and symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Especially in older people, the incidences of malignant conditions appear to be increased in dermatomyositis patients, and the prognosis is very poor. Because dermatomyositis may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome, extensive screening tests, for an occult malignant neoplasm, should be conducted in older dermatomyositis patients. We experienced a case of small cell lung cancer, which had a very rapid and catastrophic clinical course, in a 63-year-old male patient with dermatomyositis. We report this case, and review the literature on the relationship of dermatomyositis and malignancy.

AB  - Background: Risk assessment for pulmonary resection in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is important for minimizing postoperative morbidity. Depletion of skeletal muscle mass is closely associated with impaired nutritional status and limited physical ability. We evaluated the relationship between skeletal muscle depletion and early postoperative complications in patients with early-stage NSCLC., Methods: Patients who underwent curative lung resection between 2016 and 2018 and who were diagnosed with pathological stage I/II NSCLC were included, and their records were retrospectively analyzed. The psoas volume index (PVI, cm3/m3) was calculated based on computed tomography images from routine preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Early postoperative complications, defined as those occurring within 90 days of surgery, were compared between the lowest sex-specific quartile for PVI and the remaining quartiles., Results: A strong correlation was found between the volume and the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle (R2=0.816). The overall rate of complications was 57.6% among patients with a low PVI and 32.8% among those with a normal-to-high PVI. The most common complication was prolonged air leak (low PVI, 16.9%; normal-to-high PVI, 9.6%), followed by pneumonia (low PVI, 13.6%; normal-to-high PVI, 7.9%) and recurrent pleural effusion (low PVI, 11.9%; normal-to-high PVI, 6.8%). The predictors of overall complications were low PVI (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-4.09; p=0.03), low hemoglobin level (OR, 0.686; 95% CI, 0.54-0.87; p=0.002), and smoking history (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 2.03-7.58; p<0.001)., Conclusion: Low PVI was associated with a higher rate of early postoperative complications in patients with early-stage NSCLC.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Cachexia is defined as a complex metabolic syndrome that is associated with underlying illness and a loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. This disease is associated with a high incidence with chronic diseases such as heart failure, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), among others. Since there is currently no effective treatment available, cachectic patients have a poor prognosis. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms is, therefore, an important medical task. Recent Advances: There is accumulating evidence that the diseased organs such as heart, lung, kidney, or cancer tissue secrete soluble factors, including Angiotensin II, myostatin (growth differentiation factor 8 [GDF8]), GDF11, tumor growth factor beta (TGFbeta), which act on skeletal muscle. There, they induce a set of genes called atrogenes, which, among others, induce the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to protein degradation. Moreover, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels due to modulation of NADPH oxidases (Nox) and mitochondrial function contribute to disease progression, which is characterized by loss of muscle mass, exercise resistance, and frailty., CRITICAL ISSUES: Although substantial progress was achieved to elucidate the pathophysiology of cachexia, effectice therapeutic strategies are urgently needed., FUTURE DIRECTIONS: With the identification of key components of the aberrant inter-organ communication leading to cachexia, studies in mice and men to inhibit ROS formation, induction of anti-oxidative superoxide dismutases, and upregulation of muscular nitric oxide (NO) formation either by pharmacological tools or by exercise are promising approaches to reduce the extent of skeletal muscle wasting.

AB  - Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in physical activity and in regulating body energy and protein balance. Myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are indispensable processes for myoblast myogenesis. Profilin 2a (PFN2a) is a ubiquitous actin monomer-binding protein and promotes lung cancer growth and metastasis through suppressing the nuclear localization of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). However, how PFN2a regulates myoblast myogenic development is still not clear. We constructed a C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line overexpressing PFN2a. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to study the function of PFN2a in C2C12 myogenic development. We find that PFN2a suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis and consequentially downregulates C2C12 myogenic development. The suppression of PFN2a also decreases the amount of HDAC1 in the nucleus and increases the protein level of p53 during C2C12 myogenic development. Therefore, we propose that PFN2a suppresses C2C12 myogenic development via the p53 pathway. Si-p53 (siRNA-p53) reverses the PFN2a inhibitory effect on C2C12 proliferation and the PFN2a promotion effect on C2C12 apoptosis, and then attenuates the suppression of PFN2a on myogenic differentiation. Our results expand understanding of PFN2a regulatory mechanisms in myogenic development and suggest potential therapeutic targets for muscle atrophy-related diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption enhances cancer-associated cachexia, which is one of the major causes of decreased survival. The precise molecular mechanism of how alcohol consumption enhances cancer-associated cachexia, especially skeletal muscle loss, remains to be elucidated., METHODS: We used a mouse model of chronic alcohol consumption, in which 20% (w/v) alcohol was provided as sole drinking fluid, and Lewis lung carcinoma to study the underlying mechanisms., RESULTS: We found that alcohol consumption up-regulated the expression of MAFbx, MuRF-1, and LC3 in skeletal muscle, suggesting that alcohol enhanced ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and LC3-mediated autophagy. Alcohol consumption enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2/3, p38, and ERK and decreased the phosphorylation of FOXO1. These are the signaling molecules governing protein degradation pathways. Moreover, alcohol consumption slightly up-regulated the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1, did not affect phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, but decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and down-regulated the expression of Raptor and p70 ribosomal kinase S6 kinase, suggesting that alcohol impaired protein synthesis signaling pathway in skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice. Alcohol consumption enhanced the expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle, plasma, and tumor, but did not affect the expression of myostatin in non-tumor-bearing mice. In TNFalpha knockout mice, the effects of alcohol-enhanced expression of myostatin and protein degradation-related signaling molecules, and decreased protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle were abolished. Consequently, alcohol consumption neither affected cancer-associated cachexia nor decreased the survival of TNFalpha KO mice bearing cachectic cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Chronic alcohol consumption enhances cancer-associated skeletal muscle loss through suppressing Akt/mTOR-mediated protein synthesis pathway and enhancing protein degradation pathways. This process is initiated by TNFalpha and mediated by myostatin. Copyright © 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

AB  - Although ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) is a well-known paraneoplastic phenomenon, an association with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) has not been reported. We describe a 63-year-old man with metastatic LCNEC to the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ) who presented with progressive muscle weakness and bilateral lower leg edema for 2 weeks. He did not have a typical Cushingoid appearance nor used diuretics. His newly noted hypertension, hypokalemia (plasma potassium (K) concentration 1.8 mEq/L) with renal K wasting, and metabolic alkalosis suggested a state of mineralocorticoid excess. His plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were low, but cortisol and ACTH levels were extremely elevated, consistent with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Nonsuppressible plasma cortisol level and normal sella turcica on magnetic resonance imaging pointed to EAS. A strongly positive stain for ACTH from the metastatic left TMJ mass supported LCNEC-related EAS. His hypokalemia and hypertension were controlled with spironolactone and K supplementation. This is the first reported case of EAS in LCNEC and should be kept in mind as a cause of hypokalemia in lung cancer patients.

AB  - In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels reduce the quantal release of acetylcholine, causing muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. More than half of the affected patients have associated small cell lung cancer, and thorough screening for an underlying malignancy is crucial. The mainstay of treatment for LEMS is symptomatic but immunotherapy is needed in more severely affected patients. Symptomatic therapies aim at increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the muscle endplate. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were the first drugs to be used for the amelioration of symptoms, 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP, amifampridine) has been shown to be more effective. 3,4-DAP blocks presynaptic potassium channels, thereby prolonging the action potential and increasing presynaptic calcium concentrations. This then results in increased quantal release of acetylcholine. The efficacy of 3,4-DAP for increasing muscle strength and resting compound muscle action potentials has been demonstrated by four placebo-controlled trials. Side effects are usually mild, and the most frequently reported are paresthesias. The most common serious adverse events are epileptic seizures. 3,4-DAP is currently the treatment of choice in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a cancer-induced multifactorial debilitating syndrome directly accounting for 20% of cancer deaths without effective therapeutic approaches. It is extremely urgent to explore effective anti-cachexia drugs to ameliorate muscle and fat loss in cachexia patients., METHODS: Lewis lung carcinoma bearing C57BL/6 mice were applied as the animal model to examine the therapeutic effect of Coix seed oil (CSO) on cancer cachexia. The food intake and body weight change were monitored every 3 days throughout the experiment. The IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in serum were detected by ELISA assay. Several key proteins involved in muscle wasting and fat lipolysis were tested by Western blot to identify the potential mechanism of CSO., RESULTS: Administration of CSO through gavage significantly prevented body weight loss and ameliorated systemic inflammation without affecting food intake and tumor size. The weight and histological morphology of gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal adipose tissue in CSO-treated mice were also improved. In mechanism, we found that CSO decreased the expression of MuRF1 and the ratio of phospho-p65 (Ser536) to p65 in muscle tissue. Meanwhile, cancer-induced activation of HSL and AMPK was also inhibited by CSO administration., CONCLUSION: Coix seed oil exerts an anti-cachexia pharmaceutical effect by counteracting muscle and adipose tissue loss most likely through regulating NF-kappaB-MuRF1 and AMPK-HSL pathway.

AB  - Muscle wasting is the key manifestation of cancer-associated cachexia, a lethal metabolic disorder seen in over 50% of cancer patients. Autophagy is activated in cachectic muscle of cancer hosts along with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), contributing to accelerated protein degradation and muscle wasting. However, established signaling mechanism that activates autophagy in response to fasting or denervation does not seem to mediate cancer-provoked autophagy in skeletal myocytes. Here, we show that p38beta MAPK mediates autophagy activation in cachectic muscle of tumor-bearing mice via novel mechanisms. Complementary genetic and pharmacological manipulations reveal that activation of p38beta MAPK, but not p38alpha MAPK, is necessary and sufficient for Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-induced autophagy activation in skeletal muscle cells. Particularly, muscle-specific knockout of p38beta MAPK abrogates LLC tumor-induced activation of autophagy and UPP, sparing tumor-bearing mice from muscle wasting. Mechanistically, p38beta MAPK-mediated activation of transcription factor C/EBPbeta is required for LLC-induced autophagy activation, and upregulation of autophagy-related genes LC3b and Gabarapl1. Surprisingly, ULK1 activation (phosphorylation at S555) by cancer requires p38beta MAPK, rather than AMPK. Activated ULK1 forms a complex with p38beta MAPK in myocytes, which is markedly increased by a tumor burden. Overexpression of a constitutively active p38Tbeta; MAPK in HEK293 cells increases phosphorylation at S555 and other amino acid residues of ULK1, but not several of AMPK-mediated sites. Finally, ULK1 activation is abrogated in tumor-bearing mice with muscle-specific knockout of p38beta MAPK. Thus, p38beta MAPK appears a key mediator of cancer-provoked autophagy activation, and a therapeutic target of cancer-induced muscle wasting.

AB  - The implantation of the Lewis lung carcinoma (a fast-growing mouse tumour that induces cachexia) to both wild-type and transgenic mice for the soluble TNF receptor type I protein (sTNF-R1) resulted in a considerable loss of carcass weight in both groups. However, while in the wild-type mice there was a loss of both fat and muscle, in the transgenic mice muscle waste was not affected to the same extent as in the wild-type group. Muscle waste in wild-type mice was accompanied by an increase in the fractional rate of protein degradation, while no changes were observed in protein synthesis. The result was a decreased rate of protein accumulation which accounted for the muscle weight loss observed as a result of the tumour burden. In contrast, transgenic mice did not have such low rates of protein accumulation after tumour implantation. The increase in protein degradation in the tumour-bearing transgenic mice was accompanied by a similar increase in protein synthesis which compensated for the loss of muscle protein by degradation. Both tumour-bearing groups showed an enhanced expression of ubiquitin and proteasome C8 subunit genes, all of them related to the activation of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system in skeletal muscle. It is suggested that TNF may, in part, be responsible for the loss of protein in skeletal muscle of tumour-bearing mice.

AB  - The implantation of the Lewis lung carcinoma (a fast-growing mouse tumour that induces cachexia) to both wild-type and gene-deficient mice for the TNF-alpha receptor type I protein (Tnfr1 degree/Tnfr1 degree), resulted in a considerable loss of carcass weight in both groups. However, while in the wild-type mice there was a loss of both fat and muscle, in the gene-knockout mice muscle wastage was not affected to the same extent. In both groups, tumour burden resulted in significant increases in circulating TNF-alpha, a cytokine which, as we have previously demonstrated, can induce protein breakdown in skeletal muscle. Muscle wastage in wild-type mice was accompanied by an increase in the fractional rate of protein degradation, while no changes were observed in protein synthesis. The result is a decreased rate of protein accumulation that accounts for the muscle weight loss observed as a result of tumour burden. In contrast, gene knockout mice did not have significantly lower rates of protein accumulation as a result of tumour implantation. The increase in protein degradation in the tumour-bearing wild mice was accompanied by an enhanced expression of both ubiquitin and proteasome subunit genes, all of them related to the activation of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system in skeletal muscle. Tumour-bearing gene-deficient mice did not show any increase in gene expression. It is concluded that TNF-alpha (alone or in combination with other cytokines) is responsible for the activation of protein breakdown in skeletal muscle of tumour-bearing mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to describe the clinical features of patients with ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS) from Colombia and compare these findings with other series to provide the best management for these patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of patients with ECS from 1986 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed; patients with a diagnosis of adrenal or pituitary Cushing syndrome (CS) were excluded., RESULTS: Fourteen patients with ECS were analyzed in this study. The mean age was 54.4 (SD 17.1) years, and the female to male ratio was 1.33:1. Regarding the etiology of ECS, four patients had lung carcinoids (28.6%), three had small-cell lung carcinoma (21.4%), three had pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (21.4%), one had medullary thyroid cancer (7.1%), one had non-metastatic pheochromocytoma (7.1%), one had metastatic thymoma (7.1%) and one patient had an occult source of ACTH (7.1%). The most common clinical features at presentation were moon-face, muscle weakness, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hyperpigmentation was present in 36% of patients, and 12 patients had hypokalemia with a mean value of 2.3 mEq/L (SD 0.71). The median basal cortisol, 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) and ACTH were 30.5 ug/dL (IQR 21-59 ug/dL), 2,600 ug/24 h (IQR 253-6,487 ug/24 h) and 91 pg/mL (IQR 31.9-141.9), respectively. Thirteen patients (92.8%) had the site of the primary lesion identified. Six patients had undergone a surgical intervention to address the primary tumor. Resection was curative in 28.5% of patients. Death occurred in 57.1% of patients, and the median overall survival was 27 months. Intrathoracic tumors had the most aggressive behavior., CONCLUSIONS: ECS is a rare disease; however, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. A rapid intervention supported by an interdisciplinary group is required to improve overall survival and quality of life.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome, characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and not fully reversible by nutritional support. Recent animal observations suggest that production of Activin A (ActA) and Myostatin (Mstn) by some tumors might contribute to cancer cachexia., OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to investigate the role of ActA and Mstn in the development of the human cancer cachexia., DESIGN/SETTING: The ACTICA study is a cross-sectional study, which prospectively enrolled patients from a tertiary-care center between January 2012 and March 2014. Subjects/Outcome Measures: One hundred fifty two patients with colorectal or lung cancer had clinical, nutritional and functional assessment. Body composition was measured by CT-scan, anthropometry, and bioimpedance. Plasma concentrations of ActA, Mstn, and Follistatin were determined., RESULTS: Cachexia was associated with reduced lean and fat mass (p < .01 and p < .001), reduced physical function, lower quality of life, and increased symptoms (QLQC30; p < .001). Anorexia (SNAQ score < 14) was more common in cachectic patients (CC) than in noncachectic patients (CNC) (p < .001). ActA concentrations in CC patients were higher than in CNC patients (+40%; p < .001) and were correlated positively with weight loss (R = 0.323; p < .001) and negatively with the SNAQ score (R = -0.225; p < .01). In contrast, Mstn concentrations were decreased in CC patients compared to CNC patients (-35%; p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an association between circulating concentrations of ActA and the presence of the anorexia/cachexia syndrome in cancer patients. Given the known muscle atrophic effects of ActA, our study suggests that increased circulating concentrations of ActA may contribute to the development of cachexia in cancer patients.

AB  - Introduction. Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM) and subacute sensory neuronopathy (SSN) are remote effects of cancer, usually associated with small-cell lung carcinoma and positive anti-Hu antibody. We describe the rare association of bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with anti-Hu antibody positivity resulting in this paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Patient. A 76-year-old female presented with bilateral muscle weakness and paraesthesia of the upper and lower limbs in a length-dependent "glove and stocking" distribution. Central nervous system symptoms included cognitive problems, personality change, and truncal ataxia. Case notes and the literature were reviewed. Result. Autoantibody screening was positive for anti-Hu antibody (recently renamed antineuronal nuclear antibody 1, ANNA-1). The diagnosis of PEM and SSN was supported by MRI and lumbar puncture results. A superficial bladder TCC was demonstrated on CT and subsequently confirmed on histology. No other primary neoplasm was found on full-body imaging. The neurological symptoms were considered to be an antibody-mediated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome and improved after resection of the tumour. Discussion. The association of anti-Hu positive paraneoplastic neurological syndrome and TCC has not been described in the literature previously. We emphasize the need for detailed clinical examination and the importance of a multidisciplinary thought process and encourage further awareness of this rare association.

AB  - Long-term cigarette smoking (LTCS) represents an important risk factor for cardiac infarction and stroke and the central risk factor for the development of a bronchial carcinoma, smoking-associated interstitial lung fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The pathophysiologic development of these diseases is suggested to be promoted by chronic and progressive inflammation. Cigarette smoking induces repetitive inflammatory insults followed by a chronic and progressive activation of the immune system. In the pulmonary system of cigarette smokers, oxidative stress, cellular damage, and a chronic activation of pattern recognition receptors are described which are followed by the translocation of the NF-kB, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteases, and damage-associated molecular patterns. In parallel, smoke pollutants cross directly through the alveolus-capillary interface and spread through the systemic bloodstream targeting different organs. Consequently, LTCS induces a systemic low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress in the vascular system. In blood, these processes promote an increased coagulation and endothelial dysfunction. In muscle tissue, inflammatory processes activate catabolic signaling pathways followed by muscle wasting and sarcopenia. In brain, several characteristics of neuroinflammation were described. Regular exercise training has been shown to be an effective nonpharmacological treatment strategy in smoke-induced pulmonary diseases. It is well established that exercise training exerts immune-regulating effects by activating anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. In this regard, the release of myokines from contracting skeletal muscle, the elevations of cortisol and adrenalin, the reduced expression of Toll-like receptors, and the increased mobilization of immune-regulating leukocyte subtypes might be of vital importance. Exercise training also increases the local and systemic antioxidative capacity and several compensatory mechanisms in tissues such as an increased anabolic signaling in muscle or an increased compliance of the vascular system. Accordingly, regular exercise training seems to protect long-term smokers against some important negative local and systemic consequences of smoking. Data suggest that it seems to be important to start exercise training as early as possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia represented by low psoas muscle area is associated with increased hospital length of stay (LOS), postoperative complications, and mortality. We studied whether thoracic skeletal muscle area (TSMA) derived from computed tomography (CT) predicts morbidity after pneumonectomy for lung cancer., METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent pneumonectomy for lung cancer from 2005 to 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. TSMA was defined as the sum of muscle area at the level of the eighth and the 12th thoracic vertebral bodies on preoperative CT. Patients were stratified into sex-specific TSMA quartiles for univariate time-to-event analyses. The effect of continuous TSMA measurements on operative complications, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, discharge disposition, and hospital readmission within 90 days was estimated using multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, Zubrod score, and pneumonectomy type., RESULTS: Standard (n = 102, 78.5%) or high-risk (n = 28, 21.5%; extrapleural: n = 3, 2.3%; carinal: n = 9, 6.9%; completion: n = 16, 12.3%) pneumonectomy was performed in 130 patients (60.8 +/- 10.6 years; 43.1% women). Major complications occurred in 33.1% (n = 43 of 130) and readmission in 17.7% (n = 23 of 130) of patients. In multivariable models, patients with high TSMA experienced fewer overall (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; P = .04) and cardiopulmonary (OR, 0.86; P = .04) complications, and fewer readmissions (OR, 0.78; P = .01). Associations with ICU LOS (hazard ratio, 1.08; P = .051) and hospital LOS (hazard ratio, 1.05; P = .18) did not reach significance., CONCLUSIONS: TSMA predicts adverse outcome after pneumonectomy for lung cancer. This marker, readily derived from standard chest CT, identifies patients at increased risk for postoperative complications and may help select patients appropriate for focused rehabilitation before pneumonectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is an autoimmune presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Treatments have attempted to overcome the harmful autoimmune process, or to improve residual neuromuscular transmission, in order to reverse the principal neurological symptom of muscle weakness., OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the efficacy of all forms of treatment in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome., SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised trials register (September 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2002) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2002). We checked the bibliographies in reports of the randomised trials and contacted authors to identify additional published or unpublished data., SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: all randomised or quasi-randomised trials., TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: all adults and children with a diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, with or without small-cell lung cancer. Types of interventions: any form of medical (pharmacological or physical) treatment. Types of outcome measures: Primary: change in the muscle strength scale score (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score), or limb muscle strength measured by myometry. Secondary: improvement in the mean amplitude of the resting compound muscle action potentials. The mean amplitude used was the mean of all muscles tested., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified three randomised controlled trials. Individual patient data were only available for one trial., MAIN RESULTS: The three eligible trials included two controlled trials of the effects of 3,4-diaminopyridine compared with placebo in a total of 38 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one of which was of crossover design. A third crossover trial compared intravenous immunoglobulin treatment to placebo in nine patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. A meta-analysis of the primary endpoint results of these trials was not possible because of differences in comparisons and endpoints and, in two trials, lack of individual patient data. EFFECTS OF 3,4-DIAMINOPYRIDINE: Two trials of 3,4-diaminopyridine reported a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of muscle strength score, or myometric limb measurement following treatment. Both trials also reported a significant improvement in the secondary endpoint of resting compound muscle action potential amplitude following 3,4-diaminopyridine, compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of the primary endpoint results was not possible because of marked differences in these two trials regarding primary outcome measures. However, a meta-analysis of the secondary endpoint (improvement in the amplitude of the mean resting compound muscle action potential) was possible. It was necessary to assume a known correlation (similarity) of the paired responses for each individual in the two treatment periods in order to properly allow for the crossover design of one of the two trials (the correlation coefficient was assumed to be 0.5 in calculations). Using this approach, meta-analysis revealed a significant overall benefit in compound muscle action potential amplitude after 3,4-diaminopyridine treatment. The overall weighted mean difference was 1.80 mV (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.78), favouring treatment. These results were not sensitive to the assumption made because the overall benefit estimated was still significant when the correlation was assumed to be less than 0.1. EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN: A crossover trial reported a significant improvement in the primary outcome measure of myometric limb strength when patients received intravenous immunoglobulin compared to placebo infusions. This trial also demonstrated an improvement in the secondary outcome measure of change in the mean resting compound muscle action potential amplitude following intravenous immunoglobulin, but this improvement did not reach significance. Clinical improvement lasted for up to eight weeks., REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence from randomised control ed trials showed that either 3,4-diaminopyridine or intravenous immunoglobulin improved muscle strength scores and compound muscle action potential amplitudes in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. There are insufficient data at present to quantify this treatment effect. Other possible treatments, such as plasma exchange, steroids and immunosuppressive agents have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.

AB  - Patients with lung cancer experience muscle wasting and weakness. Therapeutic exercise may be beneficial but is not always practical. An alternative approach may be neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the quadriceps muscles, but this has not been formally examined in patients with cancer. Thus, we have undertaken this pilot study to assess feasibility and inform the design of future studies. Sixteen patients were randomized to receive usual care (control group) or usual care plus NMES for four weeks. NMES consisted of daily stimulation to both thighs for up to 30minutes (frequency 50Hz, "on" cycle 11%-25%). Adherence was assessed by a self-report diary and a semistructured evaluation form. Quadriceps muscle strength, exercise endurance, and free-living physical activity were assessed using a Cybex NORM dynamometer, an endurance shuttle walk test, and an ActivPAL accelerometer (mean daily step count), respectively. Changes in outcome from baseline were compared between groups by mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals using independent t-test (P=0.05). Median (range) adherence to the program was 80% (69%-100%). All patients found the NMES device easy to use. Changes in outcome favored the NMES group, with mean differences of 9.4 Nm (21%) in quadriceps muscle strength, 768 steps (15%) in free-living activity, and 138 m (8%) in exercise endurance, but none of the differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, NMES warrants further study in patients with lung cancer.

AB  - An esophageal cancer patient with bilateral lungs and neck lymph nodes metastases received 24 mg of vincristine instead of vinblastine because of the similarity between the two names, and survived multiorgan derangement. Serious states of central and peripheral neuropathy with muscle atrophy, gastrointestinal disorder, bone marrow suppression and mucocutaneous involvement were all encountered. Although hypotension and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) were not observed as vincristine's side actions, toxicity to the myocardium, which has not been documented, was suggested in our case. These toxic impairments, however, subsided clinically within a month, except for paresthesia in the peripheral extremities. The effectiveness of the chemotherapy was remarkable against both the esophageal cancer and the metastatic lesions. No unintentional overdose of a drug, needless to say, should happen, and in order to minimize its possibility, it would be advisable for chemotherapy to be administered only by an experienced physician who is able to check the dose and concentration.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that has an association with malignancy in adults. We present a patient who initially presented with adenopathy and progressive muscular weakness and was diagnosed with dermatomyositis and lung carcinoma on further investigation. Whole-body PET/CT scan revealed diffuse proximal muscle hypermetabolism representing the inflammatory nature of dermatomyositis, and an intensely FDG-avid primary right lower lung small cell lung carcinoma and metastatic thoracic lymphadenopathy. PET/CT imaging may offer an "all-in-one" procedure as an alternative to other diagnostic procedures, reducing the number of unnecessary investigations in patients presenting with paraneoplastic syndromes searching for underlying malignancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The number of geriatric patients with esophageal cancer has been increasing. Geriatric syndromes such as sarcopenia might adversely affect postoperative recovery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between sarcopenia and postoperative complications, and the associations between sarcopenia and perioperative functional changes in patients with esophageal cancer following esophagectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants comprised 104 patients who underwent esophagectomy from July 2011 to April 2015. Preoperative sarcopenia was diagnosed by the presence of low muscle mass and low physical functions according to Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. Low physical function was defined by loss of grip strength and/or slow walking speed. Postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications were extracted. Perioperative functional changes were calculated (value at postoperative day 30-value before surgery). For statistical analyses, both uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (27.9%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (37.9%) than in the non-sarcopenia group (17.3%; P=0.04). There was no relationship between sarcopenia and other complications or perioperative functional changes. Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR), 3.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-8.93) and high Brinkman index (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.20-11.77) as independent risk factors for the development of pulmonary complications., CONCLUSION: The assessment of sarcopenia may be useful to predict the postoperative pulmonary complications following esophagectomy. On the other hand, sarcopenia does not predict cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications or perioperative function. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an idiopathic or paraneoplastic syndrome producing antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated P/Q calcium channels. This decreases calcium entry into the presynaptic terminal, which prevents binding of vesicles to the presynaptic membrane and acetylcholine release. LEMS is most often associated with small cell lung cancer, although idiopathic presentations comprise approximately 40% of the cases. The most common initial complaint is proximal muscle weakness involving the lower extremities more than the upper extremities. Depressed deep tendon reflexes and autonomic dysfunction are frequently present. Involvement of the bulbar or respiratory muscles is rare. Diagnosis is confirmed by electrophysiological testing, which demonstrates small compound muscle action potentials and facilitation with exercise or 20-Hz repetitive stimulation. A serum test for voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies is commercially available. Treatment involves removing the cancer associated with the disease. If cancer is not found, immunosuppressive medications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used with moderate success. Patients with idiopathic LEMS should be screened every 6 months with chest imaging for cancer. Copyright 2004 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Before the use of corticosteroids, the prognosis for polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) was extremely poor. To date, although overall prognosis appears to be better, PM and DM are still considered to be associated with increased morbidity, primarily related to severe muscle weakness and visceral involvement. Recent series underline that only 20% to 40% of treated patients will achieve PM/DM remission, whereas 60% to 80% will experience a polycyclic or chronic, continuous course of the disease. PM/DM further continues to have a great impact on life in medium- and long-term follow-up, as up to 80% of treated patients are still disabled (using Health Assessment Questionnaire scores). The overall mortality ratio in PM/DM patients also remains threefold higher compared with the general population, with cancer, lung, and cardiac complications and infections being the most common causes of deaths. Predictive factors for a poor prognosis in PM/DM patients are older age, involvement of lung and cardiac systems, dysphagia, cancer, and serum myositis-specific antibodies (including coexistent presence of anti-Ro52 and anti-Jo1 antibodies, anti-signal recognition particle antibody, anti-155/140, and anti-CADM-140 antibodies).

AB  - PURPOSE: Emerging evidence suggests muscle depletion predicts survival of patients with cancer., PATIENTS AND METHODS: At a cancer center in Alberta, Canada, consecutive patients with cancer (lung or GI; N = 1,473) were assessed at presentation for weight loss history, lumbar skeletal muscle index, and mean muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units) by computed tomography (CT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Concordance (c) statistics were used to test predictive accuracy of survival models., RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) distribution was 17% obese, 35% overweight, 36% normal weight, and 12% underweight. Patients in all BMI categories varied widely in weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation. Thresholds defining associations between these three variables and survival were determined using optimal stratification. High weight loss, low muscle index, and low muscle attenuation were independently prognostic of survival. A survival model containing conventional covariates (cancer diagnosis, stage, age, performance status) gave a c statistic of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79), whereas a model ignoring conventional variables and including only BMI, weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation gave a c statistic of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95; P < .001). Patients who possessed all three of these poor prognostic variables survived 8.4 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 10.3), regardless of whether they presented as obese, overweight, normal weight, or underweight, in contrast to patients who had none of these features, who survived 28.4 months (95% CI, 24.2 to 32.6; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: CT images reveal otherwise occult muscle depletion. Patients with cancer who are cachexic by the conventional criterion (involuntary weight loss) and by two additional criteria (muscle depletion and low muscle attenuation) share a poor prognosis, regardless of overall body weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight/obese patients' large fat mass can mask the loss of skeletal muscle, which is associated with mortality in the oncology setting. We investigated the prevalence of computed tomography (CT)-defined sarcopenia and myosteatosis across different levels of nutrition risk assessed by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF). We also evaluated whether the PG-SGA SF, sarcopenia, and myosteatosis were prognostic of overall survival., METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. Consecutive patients with body mass index >=25.0 kg/m2 with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (any stage) or lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer (locally recurrent or metastatic) were screened at presentation to oncology clinics. Nutrition risk was assigned based on PG-SGA SF triage recommendations. Based on CT, patients were classified with sarcopenia and/or myosteatosis using published cutoffs. Survival analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Patients (n=1157) were 63.6 +/- 11.4 years, 64% male, and 61% had stage IV disease. Sarcopenia and myosteatosis were prevalent across PG-SGA SF nutrition risk categories (scores 0-1 [no risk; 36% sarcopenic; 44% myosteatotic], scores 2-3 [37%; 37%], scores 4-8 [40%; 41%], and scores >=9 [high risk; 50%; 49%]). In multivariable survival analysis, PG-SGA SF scores >=9 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.60, P<0.001), sarcopenia (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.46, P=0.006), and myosteatosis (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.46, P<0.001) independently predicted reduced survival., CONCLUSION: CT-defined sarcopenia and myosteatosis are prevalent across different levels of nutrition risk in overweight/obese patients with cancer. Assessment of skeletal muscle using CT adds prognostic value to the PG-SGA SF. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune channelopathy in which patients produce autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels. Autoantibodies down-regulate calcium channels resulting in reduced transmitter release, which in turn leads to muscular weakness and autonomic dysfunction. LEMS is paraneoplastic in 60-70% of patients, most frequently associated with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). SCLC lines express many neuronal and neuroendocrine proteins including neuronal calcium channels of the Cav2 family (P/Q and N-type channels). It is thus likely that the paraneoplastic form of LEMS is the consequence of an anti-tumoral immune response and the production of antibodies that cross-react with identical or homologous antigens in nerve terminals. Neurological symptoms generally appear several Months before detection of the tumor. Consequently correct diagnosis of LEMS is crucial as it can allow early treatment of a particularly aggressive carcinoma. Based on published studies, our laboratory has set-up serological assays for LEMS autoantibodies as an aid to diagnosis. Calcium channels in detergent extracts of rat brain or cerebellum membranes were labeled with radioligands specific for N-type (125I-omega conotoxin GVIA) or P/Q-type (125I-omega conotoxin MVIIC) calcium channels. Autoantibodies that immunoprecipitate the ligand/channel complex can thus be titrated. Analysis of 31 LEMS sera revealed the presence of anti-N type channel antibodies in 58% and anti-P/Q type channel antibodies in 74% of patients with titres ranging from 90 to 2950 pM. Only 5 patients were seronegative in both tests, thus a combination of the two assays reliably detected autoantibodies in 26/31 (84%) patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We report an original case of dermatomyositis associated with neoplasia, which initial clinical expression was erythroderma and multiple cutaneous necrosis., OBSERVATION: A 64-year-old patient was admitted at hospital for erythroderma. He had a diffuse and inflammatory erythema with thrill, periorbital oedema, periungueal telangiectasia and epidermal necrosis. Physical examination also revealed symmetric proximal muscle weakness as well as hepatomegaly. There were biological signs of myolysis. Complementary investigations revealed a liver carcinoma with lung metastasis. The patient first underwent topical corticosteroid treatment, which provided partial improvement of the clinical and biological signs of disease. Thereafter he was treated with prednisone and tamoxifen. Death occurred at home 4 months after the diagnosis., DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of dermatomyositis was definitely set according to the criteria of Bohan and Peter. Epidermal necrosis, present in our observation, occur classically in dermatomyositis where they are a predictive factor of association with neoplasia. Other recognized predictive factors are the age of the patient and persistent itching. Erythroderma linked to dermatomyositis is a very unusual event: 4 cases have been reported in the literature, only one of which was associated with cancer. On the other hand, numerous cases of diffuse erythema were reported, which are close to erythroderma. It is not possible to set out that this clinical form is a factor of bad prognosis of dermatomyositis. As a matter of fact, in the published cases, one does not find more frequent deceases, pejorative signs or increased frequency of association with neoplasia.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sarcopenia is a major problem of the elderly. Although little is known about the cause of sarcopenia, the intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) is known to be a cause of sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of IMAC as a cause of sarcopenia., METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent aneurysm repair and were monitored preoperatively and 3 years postoperatively by computed tomography (CT). The skeletal muscle area and IMAC were measured on preoperative L3 CT images. The clinical characteristics and risk factors for skeletal muscle wasting were assessed., RESULTS: Among the 155 patients, 38 (24.5%) had > 10% skeletal muscle wasting 3 years after the operation. Patients with > 10% skeletal muscle wasting had higher IMACs of the iliopsoas (- 0.31 +/- 0.01 vs. -0.45 +/- 0.01, P < 0.001) muscles and higher rates of cerebrovascular infarctions (7.7 vs. 23.7%, P = 0.0068), lung cancer (0 vs. 10.5%, P < 0.001), and urgent operations (0.9 vs. 10.5%, P = 0.029) and a longer postoperative fasting period (1.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.9 days, P < 0.001) than those without > 10% skeletal muscle wasting. The IMAC of the iliopsoas muscle correlated strongly with skeletal muscle wasting (P < 0.05, r = 0.70)., CONCLUSIONS: A high IMAC of the iliopsoas muscle may cause sarcopenia and thus be a clinical target in disease prevention.

AB  - This report describes the case of a 65-year-old male who complained of muscular weakness of the legs with easy fatigability. Blood and imaging examinations showed positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and an anterior mediastinal tumor (probably a thymic cyst), suggesting the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). However, neurological and electrophysiological examinations suggested the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). We searched repeatedly for malignant tumors. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was found. Chemotherapy reduced the SCLC and improved the patient's clinical symptoms. On the basis of an accurate diagnosis of LEMS, we were able to detect SCLC and administer chemotherapy at an early stage. Anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibody was negative. In our case, MG and LEMS overlap syndrome in addition to MG should be differentiated. For the differentiation, the strict electrophysiological criteria of LEMS were useful.

AB  - Steroids are commonly used for fatigue relief in terminally ill cancer patients. However, steroid-induced adverse effects including depression, myopathy, and hyperglycemia may contribute to fatigue. We report our experiences with aggravation of fatigue with steroid use in three cases. Case 1 was a 65-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer. He was started on betamethasone (2 mg/d) for fatigue, but the fatigue worsened due to steroid-induced depression. Discontinuation of steroids and initiation of an antidepressant ameliorated the fatigue. Case 2 was a 68-year-old man with advanced lung cancer. He complained of fatigue. Betamethasone (1 mg/d) was started and alleviated the fatigue. However, when the betamethasone dose was increased to 2 mg/d, the fatigue, with muscle weakness and myalgia, worsened due to steroid-induced myopathy. We therefore switched from betamethasone (2 mg/d) to prednisolone (10 mg /d). The fatigue resolved and the patient returned to his previous condition. Case 3 was a 73-year-old man with recurrent bile duct cancer. He also had diabetes mellitus. He developed fatigue, anorexia and fever. We started betamethasone (1.5 mg/d) for these symptoms, but the fatigue and anorexia worsened due to steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Blood glucose rose to 532 mg/dL. Therefore, insulin therapy was started, and the dose of betamethasone was reduced to 0.5 mg/d. His glucose level decreased to less than 320 mg/dL and he recovered from the fatigue while achieving moderate oral intake. In conclusion, the possibility of steroid-induced secondary fatigue in terminally ill cancer patients should be taken into consideration.

AB  - We report the development of spinal infarction during adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil (TS-1) after surgery for lung adenocarcinoma. A 69-year-old female had a left upper lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma, T2aN0M0. Six weeks after the surgery, tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil were administered orally as adjuvant chemotherapy for 1 year. After 10 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient suddenly showed signs of numbness and weakness in both lower limbs. The patient did not have a previous medical history, and was receiving only tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil with the stomach medication. Neurological findings showed muscle weakness, numbness and a loss of tendon reflex in both lower limbs, as well as bladder and rectal disturbance. Blood tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging and chest computed tomography showed no signs of abnormalities or metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed a hyperintense lesion between the Th12 and L1 spinal levels by T2-weighted image. A spinal fluid test indicated no abnormalities, and cytological diagnosis was class II. Anti-aquaporin 4, anti-ganglioside and anti-neuronal autoantibodies were all negative. These results indicated that the patient had a spinal infarction, rather than myelitis or paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. The patient was treated with heparin and steroid pulse treatment followed by rehabilitation, and recovered sufficiently to be able to walk using a cane after 2 months. The development of spinal infarction during anti-cancer chemotherapy has not been previously reported. In this case, an association of spinal infarction with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy was strongly indicated due to the lack of abnormalities in coagulability, atherosclerotic lesions and aortic disease.

AB  - Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is found in dairy products, reduces synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in tumor-induced skeletal muscle wasting (SMW). The B16 melanoma expresses TNFa mRNA, and induced SMW with no change in muscle levels of TNFa type 1 receptor (TNFR1) protein. A diet containing .5% CLA had no effect on SMW or TNFR1 in mice bearing B16 tumors. In contrast, the Lewis lung carcinoma expresses low levels of TNFa mRNA, induced SMW, and increased muscle levels of TNFR1. A diet containing .5% CLA reduced SMW, but had no effect on muscle levels of TNFR1. We conclude that that tumor-induced SMW can occur independent of muscle levels of TNFR1. Further study is needed before CLA can be tested in persons with cancer cachexia. Copyright 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular and autonomic disease that produces fluctuating muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic dysfunction, and often is associated with small-cell lung cancer. The pathophysiology is understood quite well; antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels in motor and autonomic nerve terminals disrupt calcium influx and reduce acetylcholine release. The diagnosis may be suspected clinically, but must be confirmed with electrophysiologic testing. Initial and then periodic screening for malignancy is essential. Tumors other than small-cell lung cancer occasionally are found. Effective tumor treatment may induce remission. Active disease may respond to agents that enhance neuromuscular transmission or to immunosuppression. Combined therapy frequently is needed and control is often marginal despite this. It is expected that availability of 3,4-DAP will improve significantly the response to treatment in most patients.

AB  - AIMS: Cancer cachexia is a syndrome which results in severe loss of muscle mass and marked fatigue. Conditioned media from cachexia-inducing cancer cells triggers metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle, including decreased mitochondrial respiration, which may contribute to fatigue. We hypothesized that Lewis lung carcinoma conditioned medium (LCM) would impair the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and increase production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration. We incubated C2C12 myotubes with LCM for 30 min, 2, 4, 24 or 48 h. We measured protein content by western blot; oxidant production by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF), 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF), and MitoSox; cytochrome c oxidase activity by oxidation of cytochrome c substrate; and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of intact myotubes by Seahorse XF Analyzer., RESULTS: LCM treatment for 2 or 24 h decreased basal OCR and ATP-related OCR, but did not alter the content of mitochondrial complexes I, III, IV and V. LCM treatment caused a transient rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS). In particular, mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) was elevated at 2 h. 4-Hydroxynonenal, a marker of oxidative stress, was elevated in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of cell lysates after LCM treatment., CONCLUSION: These data show that lung cancer-conditioned media alters electron flow in the ETC and increases mitochondrial ROS production, both of which may ultimately impair aerobic metabolism and decrease muscle endurance.

AB  - AIMS: At the time of diagnosis, 60% of lung cancer patients present with cachexia, a severe wasting syndrome that increases morbidity and mortality. Tumors secrete multiple factors that contribute to cachectic muscle wasting, and not all of these factors have been identified. We used Orbitrap electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to identify novel cachexia-inducing candidates in media conditioned with Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LCM)., RESULTS: One-hundred and 58 proteins were confirmed in three biological replicates. Thirty-three were identified as secreted proteins, including 14-3-3 proteins, which are highly conserved adaptor proteins known to have over 200 binding partners. We confirmed the presence of extracellular 14-3-3 proteins in LCM via western blot and discovered that LCM contained less 14-3-3 content than media conditioned with C2C12 myotubes. Using a neutralizing antibody, we depleted extracellular 14-3-3 proteins in myotube culture medium, which resulted in diminished myosin content. We identified the proposed receptor for 14-3-3 proteins, CD13, in differentiated C2C12 myotubes and found that inhibiting CD13 via Bestatin also resulted in diminished myosin content., CONCLUSIONS: Our novel findings show that extracellular 14-3-3 proteins may act as previously unidentified myokines and may signal via CD13 to help maintain muscle mass.

AB  - El sindrome de caquexia cancerosa es responsable de la muerte de un numero significativo de pacientes con cancer. Se caracteriza por la presencia de una ingesta reducida, con inflamacion sistemica y un metabolismo alterado. Los enfermos presentan caracteristicamente una progresiva perdida de peso y de masa muscular, junto a deterioro funcional. La perdida muscular se debe a la combinacion de reduccion de la sintesis proteica con aumento de su degradacion. Ello conduce tanto a un acortamiento como a una reduccion en el area de la fibra muscular. Asimismo, existen datos que apoyan que selectivamente algunos de los tipos de fibra muscular se ven mas afectados. Es necesario definir bien los valores de corte de sarcopenia para diagnosticar la perdida muscular y existen diferentes metodos. El sistema de la ubiquitina-proteasoma parece desempenar un papel predominante en la degradacion de la proteina miofibrilar. La tendencia a perder masa muscular en los pacientes con caquexia cancerosa parece estar asociada a la activacion de senales catabolicas por citoquinas proinflamatorias, asi como por productos tumorales del tipo factor inductor de proteolisis. En referencia a los factores pronosticos, el riesgo de muerte esta bien documentado en pacientes con sarcopenia y, especialmente, en aquellos con obesidad asociada a la sarcopenia. Asimismo, se ha establecido una relacion directa entre la perdida intensa de masa muscular y la supervivencia en pacientes con diferentes tipos de tumores del tipo de cancer de pancreas, pulmon, tracto biliar o cancer colorrectal. Respecto de la terapia en el sindrome de caquexia cancerosa, es factible que requiera tratamiento con varios grupos combinados que incluyan, junto al soporte nutricional, farmacos orexigenos, con efecto anabolico y antinflamatorio, asociados a intervenciones que estimulen el ejercicio fisico.

AB  - The incidence of lung neoplasms is increasing in Brazil and in the world, probably as a result of the increase in smoking. Due to the greater number of cases, atypical presentations appear. We report the case of a 66-year-old hypertensive male smoker who presented progressive proximal muscular weakness and, in two months, evolved to dysphagia, dysphonia, and V-shaped skin lesions on the chest. A chest X-ray showed a spiculated pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe. The biochemical analysis revealed elevated creatine kinase levels. After complementary tests and biopsies, the patient underwent right upper lobectomy. Histopathology showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The overall analysis of the case and a review of the literature allow us to suggest that the clinical profile of the patient was a result of an overlap of two paraneoplastic syndromes (dermatomyositis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) secondary to lung adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and is frequently associated with the devastating paraneoplastic syndrome of cachexia. The potent immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 has been linked with the development of lung cancer as well as cachexia; however, the mechanisms by which IL-6 promotes muscle wasting in lung cancer cachexia are ill-defined. In this study, we report that the gp130F/F knock-in mouse model displaying hyperactivation of the latent transcription factor STAT3 via the common IL-6 cytokine family signalling receptor, gp130, develops cachexia during Kras-driven lung carcinogenesis. Specifically, exacerbated weight loss, early mortality and reduced muscle and adipose tissue mass were features of the gp130F/F:KrasG12D model, but not parental KrasG12D mice in which STAT3 was not hyperactivated. Gene expression profiling of muscle tissue in cachectic gp130F/F:KrasG12D mice revealed the upregulation of IL-6 and STAT3-target genes compared with KrasG12D muscle tissue. These cachectic features of gp130F/F:KrasG12D mice were abrogated upon the genetic normalization of STAT3 activation or ablation of IL-6 in gp130F/F:KrasG12D:Stat3-/+ or gp130F/F:KrasG12D:Il6-/- mice, respectively. Furthermore, protein levels of the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), which is the central facilitator of IL-6 trans-signalling, were elevated in cachectic muscle from gp130F/F:KrasG12D mice, and the specific blockade of IL-6 trans-signalling, but not classical signalling, with an anti-IL-6R antibody ameliorated cachexia-related characteristics in gp130F/F:KrasG12D mice. Collectively, these preclinical findings identify trans-signalling via STAT3 as the signalling modality by which IL-6 promotes muscle wasting in lung cancer cachexia, and therefore support the clinical evaluation of the IL-6 trans-signalling/STAT3 axis as a therapeutic target in advanced lung cancer patients presenting with cachexia.

AB  - Background: As screening for lung cancer rises, an increase in the diagnosis of early stage lung cancers is expected. Lobectomy remains the standard treatment, but there are alternatives, consideration of which requires an estimation of the risk of surgery. Sarcopenia, irrespective of body mass index, confers a worse prognosis in many groups of patients including those undergoing surgery. Here we examine the association of muscle mass with outcomes for patients undergoing lobectomy., Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing lobectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative computed tomography scans were reviewed, and cross-sectional area of the erector spinae muscles and pectoralis muscles was determined and normalized for height. Univariate and multivariate analyses were then done to examine for an association of muscle mass with morbidity and short- and long-term mortality., Results: During the study period, there were 299 lobectomies, 278 of which were done by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The average age of the patients was 67.5+/-10.6 years. Overall complication rate was 52.2%, pneumonia rate was 8.7%, and the 30-day mortality rate was 1.3%. Mean height adjusted-erector spinae muscle cross-sectional area was 10.6+/-2.6 cm2/m2, and mean height adjusted-pectoralis muscle cross sectional area was 13.3+/-3.8 cm2/m2. The height adjusted cross sectional areas of the erector spinae and pectoralis muscles were not associated with overall complication rate, rate of pneumonia, readmission, or intensive care unit length of stay. The height adjusted-erector spinae muscle cross sectional area was inversely correlated with 30-day mortality risk, odds ratio 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60-0.98, P=0.036). Mean length of stay was 7.0 days (95% CI, 5.5-8.4 days). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant inverse association of the height adjusted-erector spinae muscle cross sectional area with length of stay (P=0.019)., Conclusions: The height adjusted-erector spinae muscle cross sectional area was significantly associated with 30-day mortality and length of stay in the hospital. Measurement of muscle mass on preoperative computed tomography imaging may have a role to help predict risk of morbidity and mortality prior to lobectomy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Tirapazamine is a bioreductive compound synergistic with cisplatin in preclinical testing. This phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tirapazamine with cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with unresectable stage III-B and IV non-small-cell lung cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy were given tirapazamine (390 mg/m2) intravenously (i.v.) over two hours followed one hour later by cisplatin (75 mg/m2) i.v. over one hour every 21 days., RESULTS: Five of 20 patients (25%) had major objective responses (95% confidence interval, 11%-50%). Median duration of response was eight months with a one-year survival of 40%. Toxicities included temporary hearing loss (25%), muscle cramping, diarrhea, skin rash and nausea/vomiting. No grade 3 or 4 hematologic or renal toxicity was observed., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tirapazamine plus cisplatin appears to be safe and active in the treatment of advanced non-small lung cancer without a substantial increase in toxicity compared to cisplatin alone. A phase III randomized study compared the combination to cisplatin alone has completed accrual. Further evaluation of tirapazamine with other active agents and in multi-modality therapy is warranted.

AB  - Background: Sarcopenia and obesity have been suspected as factors associated with efficacy of treatment and prognosis in various malignancies. This study aimed to investigate the association of pretreatment sarcopenia and visceral obesity with efficacy and prognosis of first- and second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and positive EGFR mutation., Methods: We retrospectively collected 167 NSCLC patients with mutant EGFR who had started EGFR-TKI monotherapy between October 2007 and August 2018 at our hospital. We classified 167 patients into two groups, according to the definition of underweight based on the World Health Organization (WHO) body mass index (BMI) classification and the Japanese sex-specific cut-off values of the following computed tomography (CT) images-assessed markers of pretreatment sarcopenia or visceral obesity, such as psoas muscle index (PMI), intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR) at lumbar vertebra L3 level. We compared overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of two groups by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses adjusted by age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, performance status, EGFR mutation types and EGFR-TKI lines, and extra-pulmonary metastases or three or more than 3 metastatic sites, we searched independent prognostic factors of OS and PFS of EGFR-TKI therapy., Results: The OS (median 26.0 vs. 32.3 months, P = 0.02) and PFS (9.1 vs. 14.8 months, P = 0.03) of patients with BMI < 18.5 were significantly shorter than those of patients with BMI >= 18.5. However, there was no significant difference in OS and PFS according to PMI, IMAC and VSR. The multivariate analyses detected only BMI < 18.5 as an unfavorable prognostic factor of shorter OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.81, P = 0.04) and PFS (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.11 - 2.67, P = 0.02)., Conclusions: Pretreatment underweight was a significant prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS of EGFR-TKI therapy. However, neither pretreatment sarcopenia nor visceral obesity was associated with prognosis of EGFR-TKI. Underweight may be a surrogate for advanced disease burden. Copyright 2019, Minami et al.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the association of computed tomography (CT)-assessed sarcopenia and visceral adiposity with efficacy and prognosis of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Methods: We retrospectively collected 74 patients with pretreated NSCLC who had initiated programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy between December 2015 and November 2018 at our hospital. As CT-assessed pretreatment markers, we used psoas muscle index (PMI), intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio (VSR) and visceral fat area (VFA) at lumbar vertebra L3 level. We divided 74 patients into high and low groups according to each Japanese sex-specific cut-off value. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, we compared overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Adjusted by serum albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, performance status and driver mutations, multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses evaluated various variables as independent prognostic factors of OS and PFS., Results: We could not find significant difference in response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) between low and high groups according to any factors. The OS of patients with body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 was significantly shorter than that of patients with BMI >= 18.5 (median 3.3 vs. 15.8 months, P < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in OS and PFS according to PMI, IMAC, VSR and VFA. Multivariate analyses detected no significant prognostic factor in OS and PFS, except for low IMAC (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.18 - 0.998, P = 0.0496) as a favorable prognostic factor of longer OS., Conclusions: Neither PMI nor VSR, VFA might be a significant prognostic factor of PFS and OS of ICI monotherapy for pretreated NSCLC. According to our multivariate analyses, IMAC was a significant prognostic factor of OS, but not of PFS. Thus, neither sarcopenia nor visceral adiposity may be associated with the efficacy of ICI therapy. Copyright 2020, Minami et al.

AB  - Paraneoplastic syndromes (PS) are a rare presentation of cancer, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), breast cancer and haematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of PS is challenging because it could affect multiple organ systems and it may present before the tumour is visible by imaging. We report a malignant tumour diagnosed in a male patient who referred long-term paraesthesia and proximal muscle strength loss. After ruling out common causes of polyneuropathy, the anti-SOX1 antibody gave light to the diagnosis. A pulmonary opacity in the upper right lobe was observed in the chest X-ray and a pulmonary tumour was later confirmed by CT scan. The biopsy of the cervical lymphadenopathy determined an SCLC, which caused a PS called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Our case raises awareness of a rare PS presentation, which can be diagnosed by specific antibodies, allowing early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by cutaneous Gottron papules, heliotrope rash, and proximal myopathy. It may also present as a paraneoplastic syndrome that can complicate a variety of different cancers, such as lung, cervical, and breast cancer. However, the association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of colonic perforation following steroid pulse treatment for a DM patient., CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old male complained of a skin rash that began in his neck and spread to his face and abdomen. On physical examination, the patient was also found to have symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, abdominal pain, heliotrope rash in the periorbital skin, and poikiloderma on his face and abdomen. Serum level of muscle enzymes was remarkably increased. Muscle examination revealed symmetrical proximal weakness. The diagnosis of DM was made, and steroid treatment was started for symptomatic relief. A search for causative malignancy revealed HCC. Despite steroid therapy for DM, his symptoms did not improve. Additionally, C-reactive protein elevation was seen along with severe abdominal pain on day 14 of admission. Shortly after this, the patient died of septic shock due to suppurative peritonitis after perforation of the ascending colon., CONCLUSION: Here, we present a rare case of DM caused by non-hepatitis-associated advanced HCC with colonic perforation. The cause of colonic perforation is still unclear. This case demonstrates the need to carefully monitor abdominal pain in DM patients as symptoms can be masked by steroid therapy.

AB  - A 56-year-old man had been complaining of progressive proximal muscle weakness and bilateral ptosis before his first admission to our hospital. He received an injection of edrophonium chloride, which resulted in remarkable improvement of muscle strength. Electromyographic studies revealed a compound muscle action potential that decreased after repetitive stimulation at a high rate (15 Hz). He was regarded as having myasthenia gravis (MG) rather than Eaton-Lambert syndrome because of these findings. Eighteen months after successful treatment of MG with oral anticholinesterase medication, he complained of an abdominal mass. The mass was found to be a tumor that had metastasized from a primary small cell carcinoma of the lung. Cases of MG with small cell carcinoma of the lung seem to be very rare, and the details of the relationship between them remain unknown. In this patient, MG may have developed by paraneoplastic mechanisms. This hypothesis is interesting, since it has been demonstrated recently by molecular biological techniques that small cell carcinomas of the lung express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

AB  - We provide a systematic review to support the European Palliative Care Research Collaboration development of clinical guidelines for cancer patients suffering from cachexia. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and a selection of cancer journals have been searched up until 15 April 2016. The systematic literature research yielded 4214 publications with 21 of these included in the final evaluation. Regarding minerals, our search identified only one study examining the use of magnesium with no effect on weight loss. As far as vitamins are concerned, vitamin E in combination with omega-3 fatty acids displayed an effect on survival in a single study, vitamin D showed improvement of muscle weakness in prostate cancer patients, and vitamin C supplementation led to an improvement of various quality of life aspects in a sample with a variety of cancer diagnoses. For proteins, a combination therapy of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine, and glutamine showed an increase in lean body mass after 4 weeks in a study of advanced solid tumour patients, whereas the same combination did not show a benefit on lean body mass in a large sample of advanced lung and other cancer patients after 8 weeks. L-carnitine led to an increase of body mass index and an increase in overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Adverse effects of food supplementation were rare and showed mild intensity. There is not enough solid evidence for the use of minerals, vitamins, proteins, or other supplements in cancer. No serious adverse effects have been reported with dietary supplementation. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is frequent in lung cancer and is measured using various tools, including the novel bioelectric impedance technique for measuring body composition. However, the validation of this technique for assessing body composition in advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is untested., METHODS: Forty-one treatment naive patients (all males) and an equal number of age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated by anthropometric measurements of skinfold thicknesses and body composition parameters such as body fat%, fat mass, fat-free mass (FFM), and total body water (TBW)., RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patient group was 55.7 (7.5) years, median pack-years was 20 (range, 0-80), and mean (SD) duration of symptoms was 152.6 (153.7) days. Median Karnofsky Performance Scale was 70 (range, 50-90). Majority of our patients (68.3%) were Stage IV followed by Stage III (31.7%). The percentage of patients with low, normal, and high body mass index (BMI) was 31.7%, 61%, and 7.3%, respectively. All components of body composition, i.e., body fat%, FFM, and TBW were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. However, the body composition in patients and controls with normal BMI was similar. The phenomenon of sarcopenia as a cause of cancer cachexia may explain these findings, whereas the combination of loss of body fat and lean body mass may lead to weight loss and reduced BMI., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that body composition is markedly altered in Indian patients with advanced SCLC. The impact of these parameters on clinically relevant outcomes needs further evaluation.

AB  - Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of the branched-chain amino acid leucine, is extensively used by athletes and bodybuilders in order to increase strength, muscle mass and exercise performance. We performed a systematic review of the clinical literature on the effectiveness of HMB supplementation in healthy and pathological conditions (i.e. training programs, aging, acute and chronic diseases, and after bariatric surgery). We reviewed all clinical trials indexed in Medline that tested HMB supplementation as well as all the experimental data regarding HMB intracellular mechanisms of action. Search terms included: randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, single- and double-blind method, HMB, proteolytic pathways, muscle atrophy, cachexia, and training. We found out 13 studies testing HMB in healthy young trained subjects, 11 in healthy young untrained subjects, 9 in patients affected by chronic diseases (i.e. cancer, HIV, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and 6 in elderly subjects. The indexed studies support that HMB is effective in preventing exercise-related muscle damage in healthy trained and untrained individuals as well as muscle loss during chronic diseases. Most of the selected studies showed the effectiveness of HMB in preventing exercise-related muscle damage in healthy trained and untrained individuals as well as muscle loss during chronic diseases. The usual dose of 3 g/day may be routinely recommended to maintain or improve muscle mass and function in health and disease. The safety profile of HMB is unequivocal. Further, well-designed clinical studies are needed to confirm effectiveness and mode of action of HMB, particularly in pathological conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Aging is associated, per se, with the loss of functional reserve of different organs and systems, a greater risk of vulnerability and frailty, sarcopenia and malnutrition, a reality that is extended to cancer patients. There are several factors that are associated with malnutrition in the elderly individual, such as the difficulty in regulating food intake, loss of appetite and anorexia associated with age, alteration of the senses of taste and smell, dysgeusia or economic problems. In the case of the cancer patient, other factors are added to these factors, such as: type of tumor; tumor stage; evolutionary moment of the disease; and baseline situation. Many therapeutic strategies used against the tumor, such as surgery, treatment with radiotherapy (concomitant or not with chemotherapy) and treatment with antitumor drugs influence also the risk of malnutrition. Thus, for example, concomitant chemo-radiation therapy in head and neck tumors, in lung cancer or in pelvic tumors represents a high nutritional risk antitumor therapy. Some of the repercussions of malnutrition in the oncological elderly are severe. Thus, for example, malnutrition in these individuals is associated with: worse survival; increased risk of early discontinuation of chemotherapy treatment; increased risk of chemotherapy toxicity; increased toxicity from other antitumor drugs; and increased risk of mortality during chemotherapy treatment. Taking this information into account, it is essential: to optimize the nutritional status in older patients with cancer prior to starting a systemic antitumor treatment; to carry out a nutritional follow-up throughout the treatment; and to offer early and intense management of malnutrition once it appears, with the purpose of minimizing the impact of antitumor drugs in older patients with cancer. Early management of malnutrition could improve drugs tolerance and increase the health-related quality of life in these patients.

AB  - The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) heralds the occurrence of malignancy, especially small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), but it can also occur in the absence of cancer. Twelve patients were diagnosed as LEMS by clinical features and the classical electrophysiological triad, which includes a low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), decremental responses on low-rate stimulation, and incremental responses on high-rate stimulation on the repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test. There were 6 male and 6 female patients, ranging in age from 49 to 66 years. Malignancy(all were SCLC) was found in 7 patients. Males predominantly expressed the paraneoplastic form; whereas the primary autoimmune form was found only in women, who showed a good response to corticosteroid treatment. The neurological features were similar in both groups: proximal lower limb weakness, depressed muscle stretch reflexes, and dryness of mouth in nearly all patients. Bulbar dysfunction and limb paresthesia were a little more frequent in the paraneoplastic form. In RNS tests, the characteristic electrophysiological abnormalities were found in all patients and were more profound in the paraneoplastic form. We concluded that LEMS is commonly associated with malignancy, especially SCLC, but it should also be stressed that there are many female LEMS patients who do not harbor any malignancy at all, and that other treatment strategies such as immunotherapy should be considered for these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dermatomyositis is an uncommon autoimmune disease distinguished by proximal muscle weakness and a characteristic skin rash. Dermatomyositis has also frequently been associated with malignancy, typically heralding the diagnosis of ovarian, lung, gastric, or colorectal cancer. We report an unusual case of prostate adenocarcinoma preceded by a diagnosis of dermatomyositis. We hypothesized that in this particular patient, proteins produced by the neoplastic prostatic tissue, which might be normally expressed in muscle tissue, were immunologically recognized as autoantigens., METHODS: Serum from this patient was used to screen a cDNA lambda phage expression library from normal prostate tissue for prostate protein-specific IgG., RESULTS: We identified several immunoreactive plaques encoding known autoantigens, and several encoding known muscle-related proteins, including aldolase C, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, transgelin, and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 1. IgG specific for these proteins were not specifically recognized in sera from other patients with prostate cancer compared with male control blood donors, and were not specifically recognized in a small panel of sera from patients with breast or ovarian cancer and dermatomyositis., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this patient with prostate cancer presenting as dermatomyositis had autoantibodies to specific proteins, possibly associated with his autoimmune myopathy. Moreover, given this patient's history and the multiple treatment options for prostate cancer, the identification of dermatomyositis in men should prompt an evaluation to exclude a concurrent diagnosis of prostate cancer.

AB  - A 78-year-old man presented with urinary retention and difficulty walking. Both legs showed muscle weakness, and he was experiencing lower body hypoesthesia. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions with high signal intensity and enhancement in the spinal cord and cerebrum. A cerebrospinal fluid specimen showed inflammatory changes, but negative cytology findings. Chest computed tomography revealed a tumor measuring 40 mm in diameter, and a lung biopsy revealed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. We diagnosed the patient with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome related to lung cancer. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy and chemotherapy, which relieved the symptoms and enabled the patient to achieve an independent gait.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction, and approximately 60% of patients with LEMS have a tumor, mostly small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. The clinical data of Japanese patients in the present study are as follows: the ratio of men to women is 3: 1 (mean age, 62 years; age range, 17-80 years). Of the patients with LEMS, 61% have SCLC, whereas the others do not have cancer. Clinical symptoms are usually characterized by proximal muscle weakness and dysautonomia. In less than 10% of the patients, there are signs of cerebellar dysfunctions (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration with LEMS; PCD-LEMS), and these are usually associated with SCLC. The diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting a specific antibody in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay and finding reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potential that increases by over 100% after maximum voluntary activation or 50Hz of nerve stimulation. The pathomechanism of LEMS is characterized by impaired transmission across the neuromuscular junction because of autoantibodies directed against the presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (P/Q-VGCCs). Histopathologic evaluation of the cerebellum in patients with PCD-LEMS showed a reduced number of P/Q-type VGCCs in the molecular layer. Therefore, it was hypothesized that P/Q-VGCC antibodies may induce cerebellar dysfunction after entering the CNS in patients with PCD-LEMS. Specific tumor therapy in patients with LEMS as well as cancer often improves the neurologic deficit. Tumor removal is the primary treatment for LEMS. If the result of the primary screening is negative, screening should be repeated after 3-6 months and thereafter every 6 months for up to 2 years. Most patients benefit from 3, 4-diaminopyridine administered with pyridostigmine. In those with severe weakness, intravenous gamma globulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis confers short-term benefits. Prednisone when administered alone or in combination with immunosuppressive drugs can achieve long-term control of the disorder.

AB  - The most common ectopic production of a pituitary hormone is the one of ACTH leading to Cushing's syndrome. Ectopic ACTH-hypersecretion is the cause of Cushing's syndrome in 10-15% of all cases. The ACTH-secreting tumours are often oat-cell carcinomas of the lung, less frequently pancreatic cancers, hypernephromas, or C-cell carcinomas of the thyroid. Some of these tumours may be benign or semi-benign as the rare carcinoid tumours and cause great problems in the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism. Out of 173 of our patients with Cushing's syndrome observed in the last 12 years 21 were caused by ectopic ACTH-production. Of these 21 patients 13 have a small cell carcinoma of the lung. The ectopic ACTH-syndrome often has typical clinical features caused by the levels of ACTH and cortisol leading to hypocalcemic alkalosis with muscle weakness and wasting, carbohydrate intolerance, and hypertension with oedema. The survival time in many of these patients is not long enough to allow them to develop typical signs of Cushing's syndrome though they are often highly pigmented. These patients are easily diagnosed. However, patients with small tumours which do not cause very elevated ACTH-levels and who have the more typical clinical signs of full-blown Cushing's syndrome are difficult to recognize. For the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test and dexamethasone suppression test with high doses are helpful. In special cases the venous sampling procedure for ACTH-measurements is necessary, also CT or NMR is helpful. Ectopic CRH-production is a rare cause of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Patients with ectopic CRH-production and consecutive ACTH-hypersecretion from the pituitary have not been studied extensively. There are especially no well documented results of the use of the CRH-stimulation test in vivo in this group of patients with Cushing's syndrome. On the other hand, in the documented cases, not only CRH-, but also ACTH-production was found in the tumours. So far, this rare cause of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome has to be excluded or confirmed by the measurement of endogenous CRH-levels. But until now we have not been able to detect one single case of ectopic CRH-production using a sensitive homologous CRH-radioimmunoassay over a period of more than 8 years in which we have seen nearly 120 newly diagnosed patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Only in the plasma and tumour tissue of two patients of other groups have we found high CRH-levels.

AB  - Introduction: Purpose: the main purpose of this study was to diagnose pre-sarcopenia in cancer patients who had lack of computed tomography (CT) abdominal images, with a newly discovered method based on cervical images. Material and methods: a sample of 37 patients with either lung cancer or a cancer that affected the upper digestive system underwent radiotherapy computed simulation which included measurements at C3 and L3 regions. Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) were determined by Hounsfield units and compared in both regions. Pre-sarcopenia was identified according to the cut-points currently established: <= 41 cm2/m2 in females, <= 43 cm2/m2 in males with a BMI <= 25 kg/m2, and <= 53 cm2/m2 in males with a BMI > 25 kg/m2. Results: the correlation of SMM and SMI between the C3 and L3 regions was R2 = 0.876 and R2 = 0.805, respectively. Moreover, there was a positive association (86.49%) in terms of the diagnosis of pre-sarcopenia according to both regions. In total, eleven pre-sarcopenic patients (29.37%) were identified; three of them being overweight (27.27%) and two of them being obese (18.18%). Conclusion : a single sectional cross at the level of C3 can be used for the diagnosis of pre-sarcopenia. This new method avoids unnecessary irradiation, saves hospital costs and detects malnutrition before starting radiotherapy treatment in cancer patients who have lack of CT abdominal imaging.

AB  - Cancer cachexia describes the progressive skeletal muscle wasting and weakness in many cancer patients and accounts for >20% of cancer-related deaths. We tested the hypothesis that antibody-directed myostatin inhibition would attenuate the atrophy and loss of function in muscles of tumor-bearing mice. Twelve-week-old C57BL/6 mice received a subcutaneous injection of saline (control) or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor cells. One week later, mice received either once weekly injections of saline (control, n = 12; LLC, n = 9) or a mouse chimera of anti-human myostatin antibody (PF-354, 10 mg.kg-1.wk-1, LLC+PF-354, n = 11) for 5 wk. Injection of LLC cells reduced muscle mass and maximum force of tibialis anterior (TA) muscles by 8-10% (P < 0.05), but the muscle atrophy and weakness were prevented with PF-354 treatment (P > 0.05). Maximum specific (normalized) force of diaphragm muscle strips was reduced with LLC injection (P < 0.05) but was not improved with PF-354 treatment (P > 0.05). PF-354 enhanced activity of oxidative enzymes in TA and diaphragm muscles of tumor-bearing mice by 118% and 89%, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with controls, apoptosis that was not of myofibrillar or satellite cell origin was 140% higher in TA muscle cross sections from saline-treated LLC tumor-bearing mice (P < 0.05) but was not different in PF-354-treated tumor-bearing mice (P > 0.05). Antibody-directed myostatin inhibition attenuated the skeletal muscle atrophy and loss of muscle force-producing capacity in a murine model of cancer cachexia, in part by reducing apoptosis. The improvements in limb muscle mass and function highlight the therapeutic potential of antibody-directed myostatin inhibition for cancer cachexia.

AB  - Clinical studies are emerging to support providing long chain n-3 fatty acids, found in fish oils, to prevent muscle loss, minimize side effects and improve chemotherapy response in patients with cancer. However, a recent report using experimental models made the concluding statement "..., the use of [fish oil] products during chemotherapy treatment should be avoided". This recommendation is not in line with current understanding of human nutrient requirements and needs to be carefully weighed against evidence supporting fish oil supplementation. The potential clinical detriment of consuming fish oil when undergoing platinum based therapies claimed by Roodhart et al. is not taken within the context of the collective work citing beneficial effects of fish oil in experimental models as well as in humans. Platinum-based therapies are standard of care for lung cancer in many regions of the world with no evidence that they are more or less effective than in countries where oily fish intake is minimal. Overall, the human nutrition recommendations made in the discussion of Roodhart et al. are not supported by the experimental evidence provided in the paper nor within the context of other work in this area.

AB  - Upwards of 50% of newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer patients have severe muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in advanced cancer has been shown to attenuate lean tissue wasting. However, the relationship between muscle mass and plasma (n-3) fatty acids in the absence of supplementation is unclear. We aimed to determine how plasma phospholipid (n-3) fatty acids relate to sarcopenia and change in muscle mass in non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Computed tomography images were used to measure muscle mass. Patients were classified as sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic based on sex-specific cutpoints. Change in muscle mass during chemotherapy (2.5 mo) was calculated and patients were divided into quartiles based on the rate of muscle loss or gain. Patients with sarcopenia had lower plasma EPA (16.7 +/- 2.1 micromol/L vs. 31.6 +/- 4.4 micromol/L; P = 0.001), DHA (36.6 +/- 4.0 micromol/L vs. 55.3 +/- 4.0 micromol/L; P = 0.003), and Sigma(n-3) fatty acids (63.6 +/- 5.6 micromol/L vs. 95.0 +/- 7.7 micromol/L; P = 0.002) than nonsarcopenic patients. Patients with maximal muscle loss (mean - 3.5 kg) had lower plasma EPA (12.2 +/- 3.3 micromol/L vs. 35.0 +/- 7.1 micromol/L; P = 0.03), DHA (26.9 +/- 8.7 micromol/L vs. 59.6 +/- 5.3 micromol/L; P = 0.01), and Sigma(n-3) fatty acids (57.8 +/- 13.5 micromol/L vs. 104.6 +/- 11.1 micromol/L; P = 0.005) compared with patients who were gaining muscle (mean +1 kg). Plasma (n-3) fatty acids are depleted in cancer patients with sarcopenia, which may contribute to accelerated rates of muscle loss.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The loss of muscle is common in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and contributes to the high morbidity and mortality of this group. The exact mechanisms behind the muscle loss are unclear., PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate this, 4 patients with stage IV NSCLC who met the clinical definitions for sarcopenia and cachexia were recruited, along with 4 age-matched healthy volunteers. After an overnight fast, biopsy specimens were obtained from the vastus lateralis, and the key components associated with inflammation and the control of muscle protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism were assessed., RESULTS: Compared with the healthy volunteers, significant increases in mRNA levels for interleukin-6 and NF-kappaB signaling and lower intramyocellular lipid content in slow-twitch fibers were observed in NSCLC patients. Although a significant decrease in phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling protein 4E-BP1 (Ser65) was observed, along with a trend toward reduced p70 S6K (Thr389) phosphorylation (P = .06), no difference was found between groups for the mRNA levels of MAFbx (muscle atrophy F box) and MuRF1 (muscle ring finger protein 1), chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, or protein levels of multiple proteasome subunits. Moreover, despite decreases in intramyocellular lipid content, no robust changes in mRNA levels for key proteins involved in insulin signaling, glycolysis, oxidative metabolism, or fat metabolism were observed., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that examining the contribution of suppressed mTOR signaling in the loss of muscle mass in late-stage NSCLC patients is warranted and reinforces our need to understand the potential contribution of impaired fat metabolism and muscle protein synthesis in the etiology of cancer cachexia.

AB  - A patient with a left lower lung mass had muscle weakness, generalized hyperpigmentation, metabolic alkalosis, and profound hypokalemia. His elevated serum cortisol, corticosterone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were not suppressed after midnight dexamethasone administration. Light and electron microscopic sections of the lung mass fitted the pathological criteria for adenocarcinoma. Immunocytochemical analysis of the tumor demonstrated specific staining with antibody to beta-endorphin, suggesting that the tumor cells made the common precursor molecule of ACTH, beta-lipotropin, and endorphin. This is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second case report of pulmonary adenocarcinoma associated with the syndrome of ectopic ACTH.

AB  - Paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) with two distinct neurological features was reported in a 50-year-old man who presented initially with vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, tremor, confusion, urinary retention and hypotension. Pulmonary X-ray findings, class IIIb sputum cytology, and positive anti-Hu antibody established the diagnosis of PNS associated with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two cycles of combined chemotherapy resulted in shrinkage of the lung tumor together with complete recovery of neurological symptoms and disappearance of anti-Hu antibody. Relapse of SCLC 4 months later with re-appearance of anti-Hu antibody required additional chemotherapy and irradiation. Eight months later, when multiple liver metastasis of SCLC was noticed, muscular weakness with positive waxing phenomenon compatible with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) developed. Postmortem examinations revealed residual SCLC in the primary lung, and massive liver metastasis with generalized lymph node involvement, but no tumors in the CNS. In the cerebellum, there was a slight loss of Purkinje cells with torpedo formation but without apparent lymphocytic infiltration. The present PNS was unique in that the relapse of SCLC was accompanied by the appearance of anti-Hu antibody, and that initial signs of brainstem-cerebellar symptoms, encephalopathy and autonomic failure were replaced by LEMS coinciding with the tumor recurrence.

AB  - Background: Preoperative sarcopenia has been indicated to be a potential prognostic factor for patients after complete resection of lung cancer. This study evaluated whether changes in the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) over postoperative 6 months could predict long-term prognosis from 6 months after complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data of 468 patients who underwent curative lobar resection for non-small cell lung cancer at our hospital. The 6-month postoperative change in SMI was calculated, and associations between clinicopathological factors (including the change in SMI) and postoperative mortality were examined., Results: Rates of overall survival were 90.6% after 3 years and 80.7% after 5 years. The median 6-month change in SMI was -3.4% (range, -22.3% to 14.7%). Multivariate analysis revealed that poor outcomes were independently predicted by a large change in SMI, age, pathological stage, lymphovascular invasion, and a Brinkman index of >=600. Through the analysis in training and validation sets, we determined a cut-off value of -9.9% for the 6-month postoperative change in SMI. Subgroup analysis showed that depletion of SMI during postoperative 6 months was a risk factor for poorer prognosis only in heavy smokers with a Brinkman index of >=600., Conclusions: A reduction in SMI during the 6 months after complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer significantly predicted prognosis, especially in heavy smokers. These results suggest that attention should be given to prevent the perioperative progression of sarcopenia after curative resection of lung cancer. Thoracic surgeons should take how to manage perioperatively against sarcopenia into consideration.

AB  - Background: Our previous report described how postoperative progression of sarcopenia predicted long-term prognosis after complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in heavy smokers. However, there are currently no effective means to treat progressive sarcopenia. In this study, we aimed to confirm our previous findings in a larger population and to identify factors associated with postoperative progression of sarcopenia to propose possible preventative measures., Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the data of 1,095 patients who underwent curative lobar resection for NSCLC at Kanagawa Cancer Center. We divided patients into four groups according to sex and Brinkman index (BI) above or below 600. Six-month postoperative changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) were calculated and associations between clinicopathological factors including changes in SMI and mortality from postoperative 6 months were examined. Only in groups in which postoperative depletion of SMI was shown to be associated with the prognosis, we identified clinicopathological factors associated with depletive SMI., Results: The overall survival rates of 1,095 patients were 89.8% and 82.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. The median 6-month change in SMI was -3.4% (range, -22.3% to +17.9%). Multivariate analysis revealed that poor prognosis was independently predicted by a large reduction in the SMI (cut-off value: -10%) in males with a BI >=600. In 391 heavy-smoking males, factors associated with a postoperative change in SMI <=-10% were history of other cancers (including gastric cancer) low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1.0, cut-off value: 1,870 mL), and prolonged operation time (cut-off value: 200 minutes)., Conclusions: Perioperative measures to prevent postoperative sarcopenia are appropriate for heavy smokers. We obtained some clues regarding countermeasures, one of which may be avoiding long-time operation. Further studies including clinical trials to assess perioperative anti-sarcopenia treatments, are needed. Copyright 2020 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patient with advanced cancer is one of the most vulnerable populations. Skeletal muscle depletion during chemotherapy may have substantial impact on their physical function. However, there is little information about a direct relationship between quantity of muscle and physical function. We sought to explore the quantitative association between skeletal muscle depletion, and muscle strength and walking capacity in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: Thirty patients aged >=70 years with advanced NSCLC (stage III-IV) scheduled to initiate first-line chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled between January 2013 and November 2014. Lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI, cm2/m2), incremental shuttle walking distance (ISWD, m), and hand-grip strength (HGS, kg) were assessed at baseline, and 6 +/- 2 weeks (T2) and 12 +/- 4 weeks (T3) after study enrollment. Associations were analyzed using linear regression., RESULTS: Altogether, 11 women and 19 men with a median age of 74 (range, 70-82) years were included in the study; 24 received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 6, gefitinib. Mean +/- standard deviation of LSMI, ISWD and HGS were 41.2 +/- 7.8 cm2/m2, 326.0 +/- 127.9 m, and 29.3 +/- 8.5 kg, respectively. LSMI and ISWD significantly declined from baseline to T2 and T3. HGS significantly declined from baseline to T2 and T3 only in men. Change in LSMI was significantly associated with change in HGS (beta = 0.3 +/- 0.1, p = 0.0127) and ISWD (beta = 8.8 +/- 2.4, p = 0.0005)., CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle depletion accompanied with physical functional decline started in the early phase of the chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Our results suggest that there may be a need for early supportive care in these patients to prevent functional decline during chemotherapy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration number: UMIN000009768 Name of registry: UMIN (University hospital Medical Information Network).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive thoracoscopic lobectomy is the recommended surgery for clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors, including sarcopenia, for postoperative complications in patients undergoing a complete single-lobe thoracoscopic lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC, as well as the impact of complications on disease-free survival., METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 173 patients with pathologically-diagnosed NSCLC who underwent curative thoracoscopic lobectomies between April 2013 and March 2018. Sarcopenia was assessed using the psoas muscle index calculated from preoperative computed tomography images at the third lumbar vertebral level., RESULTS: Complications developed in 38 (22%) patients, including 21 with prolonged air leak. In univariate analysis, the significant risk factors for complications were advanced age, male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, lower cholinesterase, lower albumin, higher creatinine level, pleural adhesion, operative time >= five hours, nonadenocarcinoma cancer, and larger tumor size. Multivariate analysis showed that age >= 75 years (P = 0.002) and pleural adhesion (P = 0.026) were significant independent risk factors for complications. Compared with the patient group without complications, postoperative complications were independently associated with shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age and pleural adhesion were independent risk factors for complications after complete single-lobe thoracoscopic lobectomies for clinical stage I NSCLC, and postoperative complications were statistically associated with poor prognosis. Surgical teams should ensure an experienced surgeon leads the operation for patients at higher risk to avoid prolonged postoperative hospitalization and a possible poor prognosis.

AB  - We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of 9 consecutive cases of intradural spinal cord metastasis from primary lung cancer treated at our hospital between April 1999 and March 2002. During those three years, spinal cord metastasis was diagnosed in seven of 49 (14.3%) cases with small cell carcinoma and only two of 284 (0.7%) cases with non-small cell carcinoma. Eight of the 9 cases had concomitant brain metastasis that preceded spinal cord metastasis and had received brain irradiation. The other patient without brain metastasis had also received prophylactic cranial irradiation. The interval from brain irradiation to the diagnosis of spinal cord metastasis ranged from 116 to 708 days (median 183 days). The most common initial symptom was muscle weakness of the lower extremities in five cases. Seven of the patients rapidly developed transverse myelopathy within two weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast enhancement demonstrated intramedullary tumors in seven cases and intradural extramedullary tumors in two cases. Spinal cord metastasis was often multifocal, and in each case lumbar enlargement was commonly involved. Radiation therapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy produced both neurologic improvement and a tumor response shown on MRI in 4 patients. Heightened awareness of the increasing incidence and background risk factors of this unusual complication could lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment for neurologic palliation.

AB  - A 78-year-old man with complaints of appetite loss and weight loss visited our hospital in November 2006. Positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) showed swollen lymph nodes in the abdominal para-aorta, mediastinum and neck, with intense FDG accumulation. The pathological findings of the cervical lymph nodes revealed small-cell cancer. We diagnosed extensive small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which occurred primarily in the left upper lobe. As subsequent CT revealed spontaneous shrinkage of the pulmonary nodule and swollen lymph nodes, the clinical course was monitored without anticancer therapy. In February 2007, progressive muscle weakness of the lower extremities developed. In July he was admitted with respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Although we did not administer anticancer therapy due to his poor performance status, he survived for 30 months receiving mechanical ventilation, and the tumors continued to grow moderately. We diagnosed Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) based on the clinical symptoms, the presence of anti-VGCC antibodies and waxing phenomenon on electromyography obtained in April 2009. Chemotherapy with amrubicin shrank the tumors, but his muscle weakness did not improve. Previous reports showed that a prognosis of SCLC with LEMS was better than that without LEMS. In this case, the tumors showed spontaneous regression without any anticancer therapy, and then increased moderately. The immune response was considered to have affected tumor growth.

AB  - We studied exonic trinucleotide repeats and expression of androgen receptor (AR) gene in the spinal cord from an autopsied patient with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Forty-nine CAG triplet repeats were found in tissues from the spinal cord, cerebrum, cerebellum, cardiac muscle and bladder, while there were 20-24 CAG repeats in these tissues from control subjects, consisting of three patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and three patients with lung cancer. Thus, mitotic instability of the AR gene in SBMA may not occur at the level of somatic cells. To determine whether expression of the AR gene in the spinal cord of SBMA differs from that in control subjects, we used quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blot. AR mRNA and protein were detected in the spinal cord from the patient with SBMA, but the levels of both AR mRNA and protein were less than those from the patients with ALS in whom the loss of motor neurons was similar to findings in the patient with SBMA. These findings suggest that structural alteration plus a reduced level of AR in the spinal cord are involved in the pathogenesis of SBMA, resulting in degeneration of motor neurons.

AB  - Most of the patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) are over 40 years of age at onset and have a malignant neoplasm, especially pulmonary small cell carcinoma. Juvenile cases of LEMS are rare and have not been reported in Japan. We report a 21-year-old women whose onset of LEMS was at 17 years of age. In the early stage of the disease, she had limb muscle weakness and was diagnosed has having seronegative myasthenia gravis (MG) based on decrementing response in low frequency repetitive nerve stimulation, positive edrophonium test, and negative serum anti-acetylcholin receptor antibodies. Serum anti-voltage-dependent-calcium-channel (VGCC) antibody was negative with an available assay system. She was thymectomized and received anti-cholinesterases, corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide, but their therapeutic effects were not evident. Two years later, she was confined to bed due to sever emaciation (Her body weight reduced from 47 Kg to 27 Kg.), bulbar palsy, and limb muscle weakness. She needed respiratory support and tube feeding. Type II fiber atrophy, which is non-specific, but is a common finding in LEMS, was seen in the biopsied muscle of the patient. On the other hand, postsynaptic folds and clefts of all seven motor end-plates in the specimen were normal, which is against the diagnosis of MG. Recently, she was found to have anti-VGCC antibody with an improved assay system. Despite vigorous examination, no malignancy or other autoimmune disorders have been found. 3,4-Diaminopyridine was effective to improve limb muscle powers, but she is still bedridden.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cachexia and sarcopenia are associated with poor outcome and increased chemotherapy-induced toxicity in lung cancer patients. However, the complex interplay of obesity, sarcopenia and cachexia, and its impact on survival in the context of first-line-chemotherapy is not yet understood., METHODS: In 200 consecutively recruited lung cancer patients (70 female, mean age 62y; mean BMI 25 kg/m2; median follow-up 15.97 months) with routine staging-CT before and after chemotherapy (CTX, mean interval: 4.3 months), densitometric quantification of total (TFA), visceral (VFA), and subcutaneous-fat-area (SFA), inter-muscular-fat-area (IMFA), muscle-density (MD), muscle-area (MA) and skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) was performed retrospectively to evaluate changes under chemotherapy and the impact on survival., RESULTS: We observed increases in TFA, VFA, SFA, VFA/SFA, and IMFA (p<0.05-0.001), while there were decreases in MA, MD and BMI (p<0.05-0.001) after chemotherapy. High pre-therapeutic VFA/SFA was a predictive factor for poor survival (HR = 1.272; p = 0.008), high pre-therapeutic MD for improved survival (HR = 0.93; p<0.05). Decrease in BMI (HR = 1.303; p<0.001), weight (HR = 1.067; p<0.001) and SMI (HR = 1.063; p<0.001) after chemotherapy were associated with poor survival. Patients with >=4 CTX-cycles showed increased survival (17.6 vs. 9.1months), less muscle depletion (SMIdifference: p<0.05) and no BMI loss (BMIdifference: p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: After chemotherapy, patients exhibited sarcopenia with decreased muscle and increased adipose tissue compartments, which was not adequately mirrored by BMI and weight loss but by imaging. Particularly sarcopenic patients received less CTX-cycles and had poorer survival. As loss of BMI, weight and muscle were associated with poor survival, early detection (via imaging) and prevention (via physical exercise and nutrition) of sarcopenia may potentially improve outcome and reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity.

AB  - The Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is characterised by proximal muscle weakness initially affecting gait, autonomic symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, erectile failure), augmentation of strength during initial voluntary activation, and depressed tendon reflexes with post-tetanic potentiation. The disorder is paraneoplastic (small cell lung cancer) in about 60p. cent (P-LEMS); no cancer is associated in the remainder (NP-LEMS). LEMS affects all races. NP-LEMS can occur in childhood as well as adult life; P-LEMS is unusual at<30 Years. The weakness results from a reduction in the quantal release of acetylcholine from motor nerve terminals, caused by autoantibodies to P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) that are provoked by tumour VGCCs in P-LEMS; the stimulus in NP-LEMS is not known. These antibodies may be implicated in the rarely associated cerebellar degeneration. The diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting the specific antibody in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and by finding a reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude that increases by>100p. cent following maximum voluntary activation. Most patients benefit from 3,4-diaminopyridine; pyridostigmine is less effective. Specific tumour therapy in P-LEMS will often ameliorate the neurological disorder. In those with severe weakness, IVIg or plasmapheresis confers short-term benefits. Prednisone alone or combined with azathioprine or cyclosporin can achieve long-term control of the disorder.

AB  - Immunotherapy has become a lifeline in cancer treatment. However, increasingly reports of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been linked to autoimmune disorders. We highlight two unique cases that presented with skeletal weakness and resulted in fatalities after developing de novo myasthenia gravis and myositis associated to immunotherapy treatment. Additionally, we describe the importance of early symptoms recognition and prompt treatment in preventing prolonged functional impairments and decreasing associated mortality. Patient 1: a 65-year-old male with a history of metastatic clear cell Renal Cell Cancer with metastasis to the lungs presented with unusual neck weakness, double vision, trouble breathing, and symptoms of urinary incontinence after his 4th cycle of nivolumab (480 mg every 4 weeks). He had a positive fatigability test, diplopia, and proximal weakness in bilateral upper extremities with an abnormal negative inspiratory force (NIF). Patient 2: a 83-year-old male with history of metastatic urothelial carcinoma presented with generalized weakness, difficulty holding his head up and swallowing three days after receiving the second cycle of immunotherapy treatment with nivolumab (480 mg every 4 weeks). He had proximal muscle weakness but normal sensation, fatigability tests and reflexes, very abnormally high creatine kinase (CK) greater than 4,000 ng/L, EMG results of myopathy and muscle biopsy showing focal perimysial chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. Patient 1 ultimately died due to acute hemorrhage while patient 2 had a prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation and ultimately discharged home with hospice. Prompt symptom recognition and treatment can potentially prevent prolonged impairment and mortality associated with cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Based on preclinical data demonstrating cytotoxic synergy between sorafenib and entinostat, a phase I study of this combination was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Enrollment followed the traditional "3 + 3" dose escalation scheme. Entinostat was given orally once every 2 weeks, starting at a dose of 4 mg and escalating to 6 and 10 mg every 2 weeks. Sorafenib was administered as a continuous oral dose, escalating from 200 to 400 mg twice daily. A treatment cycle was 28 days. A total of 31 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled on the study. The three dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed were grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue. MTD was not reached. The recommended phase II dose was defined as the full dose of the respective drugs administered individually. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were muscle weakness (13 %), skin rash (10 %), fatigue (6 %), diarrhea (6 %), and hand-foot syndrome (3 %). One NSCLC patient achieved a partial response. Two patients (adenocarcinoma of GE junction and Hurthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid) were on the study for more than 9 months with stable disease. The combination of entinostat and sorafenib was well tolerated. Entinostat 10 mg orally once every 2 weeks in combination with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily, representing full single agent doses of each drug was identified as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). These data support future clinical development of the combination of entinostat and sorafenib.

AB  - Tonsillar metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is rare, while anti-Hu antibodies are frequently found in SCLC. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with painful dysesthesia and muscle weakness in the distal extremities for over 1 year, progressive dysphagia for over 1 month, and severe cough and dyspnea for over 1 week. He was diagnosed with SCLC accompanied by tonsillar metastasis and anti-Hu antibody-associated paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy (PSN). The patient tolerated 6 cycles of sequential chemoradiotherapy and gradually recovered. The patient's disease remained in remission 2 years after the diagnosis with a remarkable reduction of tumor burden and a persisting high titer of anti-Hu antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first case of tonsillar metastatic SCLC accompanied by anti-Hu antibody-associated PSN, whereby the anticancer immune response was presumed to play a vital role in disease control. Unilateral tonsillar metastasis of SCLC accompanied by anti-Hu antibody-associated PSN can occur and in certain circumstances, may have a favorable prognosis.

AB  - A 64-year-old man presented with diplopia, muscle weakness, a pulmonary nodule and mediastinal widening on a chest radiograph. He was diagnosed with clinical stage IIIA (T2aN2M0) lung cancer. His neurological symptoms worsened following the initiation of thoracic radiation therapy (60 Gy) and chemotherapy. A diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) was confirmed with a repetitive nerve stimulation test that showed a waning pattern, and a positive edrophonium test, although neither anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies nor anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies were detected. The ptosis and limb muscle weakness improved with prednisolone and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment, and a partial response of the lung cancer to chemoradiotherapy was obtained. However, the ptosis and limb muscle weakness worsened again following a recurrence of the lung cancer. The herein described case, in which lung cancer and MG occurred and recurred simultaneously, suggests that MG can develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome of lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer often experience muscle wasting (sarcopenia), yet little is known about the characteristics associated with sarcopenia and the relationship between sarcopenia and patients' quality of life (QOL) and mood., MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a randomized trial, we assessed baseline QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]) and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) in patients within 8 weeks of diagnosis of incurable lung or gastrointestinal cancer, and prior to randomization. Using computed tomography scans collected as part of routine clinical care, we assessed sarcopenia at the level of the third lumbar vertebra with validated sex-specific cutoffs. We used logistic regression to explore characteristics associated with presence of sarcopenia. To examine associations between sarcopenia, QOL and mood, we used linear regression, adjusted for patients' age, sex, marital status, education, and cancer type., RESULTS: Of 237 participants (mean age = 64.41 +/- 10.93 years), the majority were male (54.0%) and married (70.5%) and had lung cancer (56.5%). Over half had sarcopenia (55.3%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, p = .002) and education beyond high school (OR = 1.95, p = .047) were associated with greater likelihood of having sarcopenia, while female sex (OR = 0.25, p < .001) and higher body mass index (OR = 0.79, p < .001) correlated with lower likelihood of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was associated with worse QOL (FACT-G: B = -4.26, p = .048) and greater depression symptoms (HADS-depression: B = -1.56, p = .005)., CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia was highly prevalent among patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer. The associations of sarcopenia with worse QOL and depression symptoms highlight the need to address the issue of sarcopenia early in the course of illness., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study found that sarcopenia, assessed using computed tomography scans acquired as part of routine clinical care, is highly prevalent in patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer. Notably, patients with sarcopenia reported worse quality of life and greater depression symptoms than those without sarcopenia. These findings highlight the importance of addressing muscle loss early in the course of illness among patients with incurable cancer. In the future, investigators should expand upon these findings to develop strategies for assessing and treating sarcopenia while striving to enhance the quality of life and mood outcomes of patients with advanced cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is characterized by loss of skeletal muscle and strength, associated with aging, poor nutrition, sedentary lifestyle, and long-term illness. We sought to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of sarcopenia assessed by computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and its predictive value for perioperative and long-term outcomes., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database to identify studies that examined CT-assessed muscle mass and outcomes of patients undergoing lung resection. Pooled odds ratio for complications and hazard ratio for survival with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated using the Mantel-Haenszel or inverse variance methods with random effects models., RESULTS: Nine observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies measured skeletal muscle at the thoracic level (T5, T12, T8) and 5 studies at the lumbar level (L3). The prevalence of sarcopenia by CT skeletal muscle measurements ranged from 22.4% to 55.8%, with an average of 42.8% in 1010 patients. Four of 6 studies that reported perioperative outcomes were included in the meta-analysis, which showed higher risk of perioperative complications for patients with sarcopenia (odds ratio 2.51, 95% CI: 1.55-4.08, P < .001). Sarcopenia was associated with worse survival in 6 of 7 studies that evaluated long-term outcomes after lung cancer resection (hazard ratio 2.31, 95% CI: 1.26-4.24, P = .007)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia can be frequently detected in patients undergoing lung cancer resection with the use of CT-based muscle measurements. Sarcopenia was associated with greater risk of perioperative complications and worse long-term prognosis. Copyright © 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of dry mouth, muscle weakness of the lower limbs and gait disturbance. The patient had dry mouth, dry eyes, positive anti-SS-B antibody and salivary gland inflammation. Sjogren's syndrome was diagnosed. Since muscle weakness of the lower limbs and gait disturbance were not compatible with Sjogren's syndrome, we considered the possibility of paraneoplastic syndrome. Serum levels of CEA, NSE and ProGRP were elevated. Chest roentgenogram and CT showed a nodular lesion in the right upper lobe of the lung and swollen lymph nodes in the hilum and mediastinum. Small cell lung cancer was diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Anti-P/Q-type Ca2+ channel antibody was positive. Electromyogram showed a reduction in the amplitude of the evoked muscle action potential response after slow repetitive stimulation and did not show a reduction after rapid repetitive stimulation. Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy induced an improvement of muscle weakness of the lower limbs. LEMS is frequently associated with a malignant tumor and an autoimmune disorder. We thought that in this patient, the presentation of LEMS was apparent because he had both Sjogren's syndrome and small cell lung cancer.

AB  - Secondary sarcopenia is defined as a decrease in muscle mass due to disease or malnutrition. Several studies have reported that secondary sarcopenia is an indicator of postoperative recurrence. We hypothesized that there is a correlation between the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and sarcopenia. We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with ICIs between February 2016 and April 2018. Patients were divided into two groups according to the change rate of the psoas major muscle area (PMMA) at the L2-L3 position and investigated the correlation between the change rate of the PMMA and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated. The objective response and disease control rates were lower in patients with sarcopenia than in those without sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) than non-sarcopenia patients. Moreover, focusing on good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status patients, sarcopenia patients showed a shorter PFS than non-sarcopenia patients. Patients with sarcopenia are associated with poor outcomes for immunotherapy among those with advanced NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is needed to validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders.

AB  - A 76-yr-old male patient with carcinomatous neuropathy associated with hepatic cell carcinoma, whose initial symptom was deep sensory disturbance followed by muscle weakness is described. The onset was subacute, followed by slow progression. Sural nerve biopsy, as well as electrophysiological examinations, revealed severe axonal degeneration without any evidence of demyelination. The autopsy findings were similar to findings described in the literature on carcinomatous neuropathy. Although carcinomatous neuropathy is usually associated with lung cancer, this report describes an association with hepatic cell carcinoma. The patient also had motor nerve involvement with positive serum anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody which decreased after immunosuppressant therapy in parallel with recovery of muscle weakness. The anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody may be involved in the pathogenesis of motor disturbance in the present case.

AB  - Doxorubicin is a widely used and effective chemotherapy drug. However, cardiac and skeletal muscle toxicity of doxorubicin limits its use. Inhibiting myostatin/activin signalling can prevent muscle atrophy, but its effects in chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting are unknown. In the present study we investigated the effects of doxorubicin administration alone or combined with activin receptor ligand pathway blockade by soluble activin receptor IIB (sACVR2B-Fc). Doxorubicin administration decreased body mass, muscle size and bone mineral density/content in mice. However, these effects were prevented by sACVR2B-Fc administration. Unlike in many other wasting situations, doxorubicin induced muscle atrophy without markedly increasing typical atrogenes or protein degradation pathways. Instead, doxorubicin decreased muscle protein synthesis which was completely restored by sACVR2B-Fc. Doxorubicin administration also resulted in impaired running performance without effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity/function or capillary density. Running performance and mitochondrial function were unaltered by sACVR2B-Fc administration. Tumour experiment using Lewis lung carcinoma cells demonstrated that sACVR2B-Fc decreased the cachectic effects of chemotherapy without affecting tumour growth. These results demonstrate that blocking ACVR2B signalling may be a promising strategy to counteract chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting without damage to skeletal muscle oxidative capacity or cancer treatment.

AB  - A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of brain metastasis and intrapulmonary exacerbation of lung adenocarcinoma. Systemic chemotherapy (PAC + CBDCA) was administered, but neurological symptoms (muscle weakness of limbs and disorientation) appeared. Lumbar puncture and enhanced MRI of lumber vertebrae revealed meningeal carcinomatosis. MTX 20 mg/week (+ Ara-C 40 mg/week) was injected into the meningeal space. There was a clear improvement in the neurological symptoms, but it did not last long. Meningeal injection was performed 7 times. Whole-brain and whole-marrow radiation along with systemic chemotherapy gave a marked improvement in the symptoms and in the metastatic shadow on the chest CT scan.

AB  - Postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery were examined along with their preoperative respiratory muscle strength and nutrition. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed by maximum inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures. Nutrition was assessed by serum levels of albumin and total cholesterol. The examined cases include 51 cases of lung tumors, 8 cases of mediastinal tumors, 9 cases of empyema, 3 cases of esophageal cancer, 2 cases of chest wall tumors, and 2 cases of giant bulla. Preoperative respiratory muscle training increased both MIP and MEP significantly (p < 0.01). Thirteen patients who had postoperative pulmonary complications had significantly lower values (p < 0.01), and did not show significant increases in either MIP or MEP even after training. The cases which experienced complications also showed significantly lower preoperative serum levels of albumin and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Therefore, patients with respiratory muscle weakness and poor nutrition have a higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

AB  - A backyard laying hen exhibiting muscular atrophy, dyspnea, and absence of egg production was analyzed for diagnostic insights. Gross findings revealed the presence of a large ulcerated mass with irregular edges involving the caudal part of the oropharynx and the cranial part of the esophagus, occluding the lumen of the esophagus and compressing the trachea. Small nodular lesions were detected also in the lungs. Histologically, both esophageal and pulmonary masses were characterized by nests of pleomorphic epithelial cells with squamous differentiation. The diagnosis was of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus with the uncommon feature of pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - A 64-year-old woman presented skin lesions on her face, upper extremities and finger erythema (heliotropism and Gottron's sign). She had weakness in her lower extremities. She was given a diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM), because the serum examination showed that a myositis-specific antibody was positive whereas Jo-1 antibody was negative. The findings of chest X-ray and computed tomography showed that she had limited small cell lung cancer, but no interstitial pneumonia. She was treated with standard chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide with accelerated hyperfractionation radiotherapy. She showed partial response to the treatment, whereas the skin lesions and muscle weakness deteriorated accompanied with bone marrow suppression due to chemotherapy. Skin and muscle biopsy were performed and pathological findings showed typical perivasculitis infiltrated with lymphocytes in muscle and skin. With the recovery of bone marrow suppression and partial response due to chemotherapy, the skin lesions improved and creatine kinase became normalized. She was given a diagnosis of paraneoplastic DM. Since severe leukocytopenia paralleled the deterioration of DM, the decrease of peripheral white blood cell counts, especially regulatory T cell counts, may be associated with DM activity.

AB  - Preferential loss of the motor protein myosin, as observed in patients with acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM) or cancer cachexia, causes generalized muscle wasting, muscle weakness and a decrease in muscle fibre force normalized to cross-sectional area. It remains unclear, however, whether this myosin loss influences other important features of muscle fibre function, such as Ca(2+) activation of the contractile proteins. To address this question, we have studied Ca(2+) sensitivity of force generation using skinned muscle fibres from four patients with AQM or cancer cachexia and a preferential loss of myosin; and from seven healthy control individuals. Force and apparent rate constant of force redevelopment (k(tr)) were assessed in solutions with varying Ca(2+) concentrations (pCa), allowing construction of relative force-pCa and k(tr)-pCa relationships. Results showed a rightward shift of the relative force-pCa relationship and a leftward shift of the relative k(tr)-pCa curve in muscle fibres with a preferential myosin loss. To improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying these alterations, the relative stiffness-pCa relationship was evaluated. A rightward shift of this curve was observed, suggesting that the changes in the Ca(2+) activation of force and k(tr) were predominantly due to a decrease in the relative number of attached cross-bridges at different pCa values. Thus, a change in Ca(2+) activation of the contractile apparatus in patients with preferential myosin loss is proposed as an additional factor contributing to the muscle function impairment in these patients.

AB  - CONTEXT: Breast cancer survivors often experience activity-related dyspnea and exercise intolerance, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown., OBJECTIVES: We evaluated physiological contributors to reduced peak oxygen uptake (VO2), with particular attention to the role of respiratory impairment., METHODS: We compared symptom assessments, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary function, and ventilatory responses to symptom-limited incremental treadmill exercise in 29 women who had survived breast cancer and 29 age-matched healthy controls., RESULTS: Peak VO2 was reduced more than 20%, on average, in the cancer group compared with controls (P < 0.001). Slopes of dyspnea intensity ratings over ventilation or VO2 were >50% greater in the cancer group compared to controls (P < 0.05). Women with breast cancer had lower lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), respiratory and limb muscle strength, and ventilatory thresholds during exercise compared with controls (all P < 0.05). During exercise, indices of ventilatory efficiency were similar to controls, but inspiratory capacity (IC) was lower and breathing pattern was more rapid and shallow in the cancer group (P < 0.05). The lower peak VO2 in the cancer group was associated with greater dyspnea intensity, and lower DLCO, IC and ventilatory threshold (all P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors had greater peripheral and respiratory muscle weakness, greater reduction of IC, impaired lung diffusion, and evidence of deconditioning compared with controls. Exercise intolerance was multifactorial and correlated well with the combination of these factors as well as with exertional dyspnea. Individualized physiological testing in breast cancer survivors can identify important contributors to exercise intolerance which can be targeted for treatment.

AB  - Cachexia is a significant loss of muscle and adipose tissue. It occurs in patients with advanced cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic infection including AIDS and tuberculosis, chronic heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. Increases in pro-inflammatory factors characterize cachexia. There is a decreased quality of life, decreased tolerance to surgical or medical interventions, and shortened survival.[1][2][3] Cachexia is not simple starvation where fat stores replace glucose as the primary fuel. Cancer causes a change in metabolism as opposed to an energy deficit, so conventional nutritional support is not effective. Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.

AB  - A 73-year-old man developed diplopia after the administration of pembrolizumab for lung adenocarcinoma. He had ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia without general muscle weakness. Serum CK levels were elevated. Although autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific kinase, the edrophonium test, and the repetitive nerve stimulation test were all negative, anti-titin autoantibody was positive, leading to the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). Muscle pathology showed necrotizing myopathy with tubular aggregates. Unlike previously reported cases of pembrolizumab-associated MG, the present case showed ocular MG. This is the first case of pembrolizumab-associated MG with anti-titin antibody, as well as the first case with tubular aggregates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia augments cancer-related mortality and has devastating effects on quality of life. Pre-clinical studies indicate that systemic inflammation-induced loss of muscle oxidative phenotype (OXPHEN) stimulates cancer-induced muscle wasting. The aim of the current proof of concept study is to validate the presence of muscle OXPHEN loss in newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer, especially in those with cachexia., METHODS: Quadriceps muscle biopsies of comprehensively phenotyped pre-cachectic (n = 10) and cachectic (n = 16) patients with non-small cell lung cancer prior to treatment were compared with healthy age-matched controls (n = 22). OXPHEN was determined by assessing muscle fibre type distribution (immunohistochemistry), enzyme activity (spectrophotometry), and protein expression levels of mitochondrial complexes (western blot) as well as transcript levels of (regulatory) oxidative genes (quantitative real-time PCR). Additionally, muscle fibre cross-sectional area (immunohistochemistry) and systemic inflammation (multiplex analysis) were assessed., RESULTS: Muscle fibre cross-sectional area was smaller, and plasma levels of interleukin 6 were significantly higher in cachectic patients compared with non-cachectic patients and healthy controls. No differences in muscle fibre type distribution or oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were observed between the groups. Mitochondrial protein expression and gene expression levels of their regulators were also not different., CONCLUSION: Muscle OXPHEN is preserved in newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer and therefore not a primary trigger of cachexia in these patients.

AB  - Cachexia is a prevalent phenomenon of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which is responsible for increased mortality and deterioration of physical performance. Preclinical research indicates that systemic inflammation induces cachexia-related muscle wasting through muscular Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling and subsequent ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-mediated proteolysis. As these pathways could be a target for early intervention strategies, it needs to be elucidated whether increased activation of these pathways is already present in early stage NSCLC cachexia. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess muscular NF-kappaB and UPS activation in patients with NSCLC pre-cachexia. Sixteen patients with newly diagnosed stages I-III NSCLC having <10% weight loss and ten healthy controls were studied. Body composition, systemic inflammation and exercise capacity were assessed in all subjects and NF-kappaB and UPS activity in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies in a subset. Patients showed increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (P<0.001), soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor 1 (sTNF-R1) (P<0.05), fibrinogen (P<0.001) and decreased levels of albumin (P<0.001). No changes in fat free body mass or skeletal muscle NF-kappaB and UPS activity were observed, while peak oxygen consumption ( [Formula: see text] ) was significantly decreased in patients compared with healthy controls. In conclusion, this exploratory study demonstrates significantly reduced exercise capacity in NSCLC pre-cachexia despite maintenance of muscle mass and unaltered indices of UPS activation. The absence of muscular NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory signaling supports the notion that transition of systemic to local inflammation is required to initiate UPS-dependent muscle wasting characteristic for (experimental) cachexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental models of cancer cachexia have indicated that systemic inflammation induces muscle-protein breakdown and wasting via muscular nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. This process may limit the efficacy of nutritional intervention., OBJECTIVES: We assessed muscle NF-kappaB activity and protein turnover signaling in progressive stages of clinical lung cancer cachexia and assessed whether circulating factors can induce muscular NF-kappaB activity., DESIGN: Patients with lung cancer precachexia (n = 10) and cachexia (n = 16) were cross-sectionally compared with 22 healthy control subjects. mRNA transcripts of muscle proteolytic (ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy lysosomal pathway) and myogenic markers and protein expression of PI3K/Akt, myostatin, and autophagy signaling were measured. A multiplex analysis showed the systemic inflammatory status, whereas plasma exposure to stable NF-kappaB-luciferase-reporter muscle cells revealed NF-kappaB inducibility., RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, cachectic patients had reduced (appendicular) muscle mass (-10%), muscle fiber atrophy (-27%), and decreased quadriceps strength (-31%). Subtle alterations in the muscle morphology were also detectable in precachectic patients, without changes in body composition. Despite increased Akt phosphorylation, downstream phosphosubstrates glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, mammalian target of rapamycin, and Forkhead box protein were unaltered. The expression of autophagy effectors B cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B gradually increased from precachectic to cachectic patients, without differences in E3 ubiquitin ligases. Systemic and local inflammation was evident in cachexia and intermediate in precachexia, but the plasma of both patients groups caused ex vivo muscle NF-kappaB activation., CONCLUSIONS: In lung cancer, muscular NF-kappaB activity is induced by factors contained within the circulation. Autophagy may contribute to increased muscle proteolysis in lung cancer cachexia, whereas the absence of downstream changes in phosphosubstrates despite increased Akt phosphorylation suggests impaired anabolic signaling that may require targeted nutritional intervention.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in different organs. Dermatomyositis is a rare form of systemic irAE. Although dermatomyositis-specific antibodies, especially anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma (anti-TIF1-gamma) antibodies, have been detected in a few cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated dermatomyositis, their titers before immunotherapy have not been examined. We hereby report the first irAE case of dermatomyositis accompanied by seroconversion of anti-TIF1-gamma antibody following nivolumab treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma. A 64-year-old Japanese male with an advanced lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1a stage IVA) received nivolumab as third-line therapy. Skin rashes appeared two days later, and were treated with a topical steroid as just drug eruptions. 7 weeks later, he was emergently admitted because of high serum creatine kinase level. Clinical examination showed deteriorated rashes along with slightly weakened proximal muscles. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes consistent with dermatomyositis. Anti-TIF1-gamma antibody was positive, which was found to be within normal range before nivolumab administration. He was diagnosed with dermatomyositis and treated with systemic corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, these drugs showed limited effectiveness against the progression of muscle weakness. He died of respiratory failure due to lung cancer and muscle weakness progression 6 months after the admission. In conclusion, our case demonstrates that the development of dermatomyositis was causally related to immune activation by nivolumab. Given the potential exacerbation of autoimmune paraneoplastic disorders in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy, clinicians should be aware of early manifestations of systemic irAEs that require prompt diagnosis and intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas muscle mass is a surrogate marker for sarcopenia: a depletion of skeletal muscle mass. This study was conducted to elucidate the prognostic significance of the psoas muscle index (PMI: cross-sectional area of the bilateral psoas muscle at the umbilical level on computed tomography/height2 [cm2/m2]) in patients undergoing surgery for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (ADC)., METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients with SCC and 556 patients with ADC who underwent R0 resection between 2007 and 2014 were reviewed for analysis. In SCC patients, the mean value (standard deviation) of the PMI was 6.15 (1.49) in men and 4.65 (1.36) in women. Among ADC patients, the PMI was 7.12 (1.60) in men and 5.29 (1.22) in women. Clinicopathological characteristics as well as the survival were evaluated., RESULTS: The PMI was associated with the age, body mass index (BMI), and serum albumin. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, after adjusting for age, BMI, serum albumin, sex, pathological stage, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, the PMI showed a significant association with the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in SCC patients (hazard ratios 0.50 and 0.56, 95% confidence intervals 0.39-0.65 and 0.45-0.71, respectively). On the other hand, in ADC patients, the PMI had no impact on the OS or DFS., CONCLUSIONS: The PMI was significantly associated with the survival of lung SCC patients, but not of lung ADC patients, suggesting the presence of a previously unidentified relationship between skeletal muscle and lung SCC progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: To assess the prevalence of sarcopenia before cancer treatment and its predictive value during the treatment., METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published from 2008 to 2016 that reported prospective observational or interventional studies of the prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia and its consequences in adults with cancer who were 18 years or older. Two independent reviewers selected articles based on titles and/or abstracts before a complete review. Sarcopenia had to be measured before cancer treatment. Methods recommended by consensuses (CT scan, MRI, dual X-ray absorptiometry or bio-impedancemetry) to assess sarcopenia were considered. Characteristics of the studies included the prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia and the prognostic value for outcomes during the cancer treatment., RESULTS: We selected 35 articles involving 6894 participants (in/out patients, clinical trials). The mean age ranged from 53 to 69.6 years. Pre-therapeutic sarcopenia was found in 38.6% of patients [95% CI 37.4-39.8]. Oesophageal and small-cell lung cancers showed the highest prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia. Pre-therapeutic sarcopenia was significantly and independently associated with post-operative complications, chemotherapy-induced toxicity and poor survival in cancer patients., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-therapeutic sarcopenia is highly prevalent in cancer patients and has severe consequences for outcomes of cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic connective tissue disease characterized by specific cutaneous findings and inflammatory lesions in the muscle biopsy. An association between dermatomyositis and malignancy, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer was recognized many years ago, with an incidence of malignancy in approximately 20 % of cases. Dermatomyositis is hypothesized to be an autoimmune reaction against factors or hormones secreted by the tumor; however, the exact autoimmune mechanism of the disease pathogenesis remains unknown., CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of a woman with dermatomyositis who was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma in the setting of weight loss, progressive fatigue and muscle weakness. A 43-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our hospital by her physician for suspected contact dermatitis since she described mild itching sensations in her arms and legs as her major symptom. A physical examination revealed erythematous papular lesions over her metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints together with a periungual involvement with redness, hyperkeratosis and capillary telangiectasia along the distal nailfolds on her hands. She was unaware of these features and they did not seem to bother her. A thorough examination of her medical history, however, revealed more symptoms. Pain and weakness in the muscles of her proximal extremities and neck flexor muscles led to difficulty in raising her arms and climbing stairs. At the same time she experienced swallowing difficulties and reported an uncharacteristic weight loss of 10 kg in the last 3 months. The results of laboratory tests showed increased values of serum creatine kinase and myoglobin. An electromyogram, a skin biopsy and a muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. A computed tomography of her thorax showed a nodular mass in the upper lobe of her right lung. A histological examination of the lung biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma of moderate differentiation. She was diagnosed with paraneoplastic dermatomyositis as the first sign of a lung adenocarcinoma., CONCLUSIONS: Our case report highlights the importance of a thorough search for underlying malignancy in patients with dermatomyositis even if dermatomyositis has a mild appearance or a discrete skin manifestation.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is characterized by extreme skeletal muscle loss that results in high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of cachexia varies among tumor types, being lowest in sarcomas, whereas 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients experience severe weight loss. How these tumors trigger muscle depletion is still unfolding. Serendipitously, we found that overexpression of Twist1 in mouse muscle progenitor cells, either constitutively during development or inducibly in adult animals, caused severe muscle atrophy with features reminiscent of cachexia. Using several genetic mouse models of PDAC, we detected a marked increase in Twist1 expression in muscle undergoing cachexia. In cancer patients, elevated levels of Twist1 are associated with greater degrees of muscle wasting. Finally, both genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Twist1 in muscle progenitor cells afforded substantial protection against cancer-mediated cachexia, which translated into meaningful survival benefits, implicating Twist1 as a possible target for attenuating muscle cachexia in cancer patients.

AB  - Regulation of muscle mass depends on the balance between synthesis and degradation of proteins, which is under the control of different signalling pathways regulated by hormonal, neural and nutritional stimuli. Such stimuli are altered in several pathologies, including COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, AIDS and cancer (cachexia), as well as in some conditions such as immobilization and aging (sarcopenia), leading to muscle atrophy, which represents a significant contribution to patient morbidity. The KKS (kallikrein-kinin system) is composed of the enzymes kallikreins, which generate active peptides called kinins that activate two G-protein-coupled receptors, namely B1 and B2, which are expressed in a variety of tissues. The local modulation of the KKS may account for its participation in different diseases, such as those of the cardiovascular, renal and central nervous systems, cancer and many inflammatory processes, including pain. Owing to such pleiotropic actions of the KKS by local modulatory events and the probable fine-tuning of associated signalling cascades involved in skeletal muscle catabolic disorders [for example, NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathways], we hypothesized that KKS might contribute to the modulation of intracellular responses in atrophying skeletal muscle. Our results show that kinin B1 receptor activation induced a decrease in the diameter of C2C12 myotubes, activation of NF-kappaB, a decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels, and an increase in the mRNA levels of the ubiquitin E3 ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (muscle RING-finger protein-1). In vivo, we observed an increase in kinin B1 receptor mRNA levels in an androgen-sensitive model of muscle atrophy. In the same model, inhibition of the kinin B1 receptor with a selective antagonist resulted in an impairment of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 expression and IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) phosphorylation. Moreover, knockout of the kinin B1 receptor in mice led to an impairment in MuRF-1 mRNA expression after induction of LA (levator ani) muscle atrophy. In conclusion, using pharmacological and gene-ablation tools, we have obtained evidence that the kinin B1 receptor plays a significant role in the regulation of skeletal muscle proteolysis in the LA muscle atrophy model.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), resulting in a clinical syndrome of proximal muscular weakness and autonomic dysfunction. Sixty percent of LEMS cases are associated with cancer, most commonly small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the 40% of LEMS patients without carcinoma, the stimulus for the production of VGCC autoantibodies is unknown; however, these LEMS patients have multiple other organ-specific autoantibodies. To investigate the autoimmune basis of noncancer associated LEMS (NCA-LEMS), high resolution typing of major histocompatibility loci was performed in 23 patients with NCA-LEMS. NCA-LEMS was strongly associated with DRB1*0301 (p<0.0001) and DQB1*0201 (p<0.0001), suggesting that NCA-LEMS is an autoimmune disorder associated with the DR3-DQ2 extended haplotype.

AB  - Glutamine is a central nutrient for many cancers, contributing to the generation of building blocks and energy-promoting signaling necessary for neoplastic proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that lowering systemic glutamine levels by exercise may starve tumors, thereby contributing to the inhibitory effect of exercise on tumor growth. We demonstrate that limiting glutamine availability, either pharmacologically or physiologically by voluntary wheel running, significantly attenuated the growth of two syngeneic murine tumor models of breast cancer and lung cancer, respectively, and decreased markers of atrophic signaling in muscles from tumor-bearing mice. In continuation, wheel running completely abolished tumor-induced loss of weight and lean body mass, independently of the effect of wheel running on tumor growth. Moreover, wheel running abolished tumor-induced upregulation of muscular glutamine transporters and myostatin signaling. In conclusion, our data suggest that voluntary wheel running preserves muscle mass by counteracting muscular glutamine release and tumor-induced atrophic signaling. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a clinical state resulting from prolonged, inappropriate exposure to excessive endogenous secretion of cortisol and hence excess circulating free cortisol, characterized by loss of the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion [2]. The etiology of Cushing's syndrome may be excessive ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland, ectopic ACTH secretion by nonpituitary tumor, or excessive autonomous secretion of cortisol from a hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. Other than this broad ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent categories, the syndrome may be caused by ectopic CRH secretion, PPNAD, MAH, ectopic action of GIP or catecholamines, and other adrenel-dependent processes associated with adrenocortical hyperfunction., CASE REPORT: A 31 year-old men with 6-month history of hyperpigmentation, weight gain and proximal myopathy was refereed to Institute of Endocrinology for evaluation of hypercortisolism. At admission, patient had classic cushingold habit with plethoric face, dermal and muscle atrophy, abdominal strie rubrae and centripetal obesity. The standard laboratory data showed hyperglycaemia and hypokaliemia with high potassium excretion level. The circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion was blunted, with moderately elevated ACTH level, and without cortisol suppression after low-dose and high-dose dexamethason suppression test. Urinary SHIAA was elevated. Abdominal and sellar region magnetic resonance imaging was negative. CRH stimulation resulted in ACTH increase of 87% of basal, but without significant increase of cortisol level, only 7%. Thoracal CT scan revealed 14 mm mass in right apical pulmonary segment. A wedge resection of anterior segment of right upper lobe was performed. Microscopic evaluation showed tumor tissue consisting of solid areas of uniform, oval cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei. Stromal tissue was scanty, and mitotic figures were infrequent. Tumor cells were immunoreactive for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, and ACTH. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on glucocorticoid supplementation. Signs of Cushing's syndrome were in regression, and patient remained normotensive and normoglycaemic without therapy., DISCUSSION: A multitude of normal nonpituitary cells from different organs and tissues have been shown to express the POMC gene from which ACTH is derived. The tumors most commonly associated the ectopic ACTH syndrome arise from neuroendocrine tissues, APUD cells. POMC gene expression in non-pituitary cells differs from that in pituitary cells both qualitatively and quantitatively [8]. Aggressive tumors, like small cell cancer of the lung (SCCL) preferentially release intact POMC, whereas carcinoids rather overprocess the precursor, releasing ACTH and smaller peptides like CLIP. Some tumors associated with ectopic ACTH syndrome express other markers of neuroendocrine differentiation like two specific prohormone convertases (PCs). Assessment of vasopressin (V3) receptor gene expression in ACTH-producing nonpitultary tumors revealed bronchial carcinoid as a particular subset of tumors where both V3 receptor and POMC gene may be expressed in pattern indistinguishable from that in corticotroph adenoma [9]. In most, but not all, patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, cortisol is unresponsive to high-dose dexamethason suppression test, what is used as diagnostic tool. It is not clear if the primary resistance resulted from structural abnormality of the native glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a low level of expression, or some intrinsic property of the cell line [9]. It appears that ectopic ACTH syndrome is made of two different entities. When it is because of highly differentiated tumors, with highest level of pituitary-like POMC mRNA, expressing PCs, high level of V3 receptors and GR, like bronchial carcinoids, it might be called ectopic corticotroph syndrome. In contrast, when it is caused by aggre sive, poorly differentiated tumors, with much lower expression of V3 receptor, like SCCL, it might be called aberrant ACTH secretion syndrome. Carcinoid tumors have been reported in a wide range of organs but most commonly involve the lungs, bronchi, and gastrointestinal tract. They arise from neuroendocrine cells and are characterized by positive reactions to markers of neuroendocrine tissue, including neuron specific enolase, synaptophysin, and chromogranina [11]. Carcinoid tumors are typically found to contain numerous membrane-bound neurosecretory granules composed of variety of hormones and biogenic amines. One of the best characterized is serotonin, subsequently metabolized to 5-hydrohy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the urine. In addition to serotonin, carcinoid tumors have been found to secrete ACTH, histamine, dopamine, substance P, neurotensin, prostaglandins and kallikrein. The release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances is thought to cause carcinoid syndrome, which manifestations are episodic flushing, weezing, diarrhea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. These tumors have been classified as either well-differentiated or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. The term "pulmonary tumorlets" describes multiple microscopic nests of neuroendocrine cells in the lungs [12]. Pulmonary carcinoids make up approximately 2 percents of primary lung tumors. The majority of these tumors are perihilar in location, and patients often presents with recurrent pneumonia, cough, hemoptisis, or chest pain. The carcinoid syndrome occurs in less than 5 percent of cases. Ectopic secretion of ACTH from pulmonary carcinoid accounts for 1 percent of all cases of Cushing's syndrome. They are distinct clinical and pathologic entity, generally peripheral in location. Although they are usually typical by standard histologic criteria, they have mush greater metastatic potential than hormonally quiescent typical carcinoids [13]. Surgical treatment therefore should be one proposed for more aggressive malignant tumors. In all cases of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome with regular pituitary MRI and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling, thin-section and spiral CT scanning of the chest should be routine diagnostic procedure [14]. We present thirty-one year old patient with typical pulmonary carcinod with ACTH ectopic secretion consequently confirmed by histology.

AB  - The region surrounding the ZNF35 zinc finger protein gene on 3p21 is of particular interest, as this region of chromosome 3 is frequently involved in rearrangements and/or deletions associated with various human tumors including lung and renal carcinoma. We have analyzed yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), identified by PCR screening, using oligonucleotides derived from the ZNF35 gene. PFGE and Southern blot/hybridization analysis revealed that the clones cover 750-kb including the ZNF35 gene. The use of specific somatic cell hybrids have allowed us to locate the YAC contig telomeric to the D3F15S2 locus, in a region which is frequently deleted in lung carcinomas. In addition, we have developed a novel cDNA hybridization protocol allowing the isolation of transcribed sequences present in the overlapping YAC clones. Using the cDNA hybridization selection, we have isolated and characterized one transcribed sequence (D3S1362E) from the 3p21 YAC contig and the corresponding cDNA has been isolated. DNA sequencing analysis indicated that the D3S1363E cDNA codes for a putative transcription factor. Northern blot analysis indicated that the D3S1362E sequence hybridized to multiple transcripts in skeletal muscle, and weakly hybridizing transcripts of similar sizes were detected in other tissues.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by body weight loss, tissue wasting, systemic inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, and altered nutritional status. One of the most prominent features of cachexia is the loss of muscle mass, mainly because of increased protein degradation rates. This review is aimed at discussing the involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of muscle wasting in cachexia., RECENT FINDINGS: Modulations of muscle mass in the adult reflect an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation rates. Muscle depletion in cachexia is associated with increased protein breakdown, mainly involving the pathways dependent on ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomes. This latter, in particular, was considered not relevant for a long time. Just in the last years, autophagy was shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of muscle wasting not only in myopathies because of intrinsic muscle defects, but also in muscle depletion associated with conditions such as sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, glucocorticoid treatment, cancer cachexia, and aging., SUMMARY: The present review highlights that both excess and defective autophagy are relevant to the onset of muscle depletion, and draws some considerations about possible therapeutic intervention aimed at modulating autophagy in order to improve muscle trophism., VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COCN/A5.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle protein, depletion of lipid stores, anorexia, weakness, and perturbations of the hormonal homeostasis. Despite several therapeutic approaches described in the past, effective interventions countering cancer cachexia are still lacking. METHODS: The present work was aimed to verify the ability of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to prevent the muscle depletion in Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice and to test the ability of endurance exercise training to increase the EPA effect. RESULTS: EPA alone did not prevent the muscle loss induced by tumor growth while the combination with exercise induced a partial rescue of muscle strength and mass. Moreover, the association of EPA and exercise reduced the dramatic PAX-7 accumulation and stimulated the increase of PCG-1 protein. CONCLUSIONS : Overall, the present data suggest that exercise is an effective tool that should be added for combined therapeutic approaches against cancer cachexia.

AB  - A 76-year-old female was referred because of violaceous dermatitis on sun-exposed skin. She had associated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dysarthria and reported an unintended weight loss. The clinical presentation gave a suspicion of dermatomyositis, and diagnostic procedures revealed a small-cell lung cancer. She was treated with prednisolone, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite intended curative treatment, she died of the cancer six months later. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough examination for an underlying cancer, in patients diagnosed with dermatomyositis.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is a highly vascularized tissue that can secrete proteins called myokines. These muscle-secreted factors exert biological functions in muscle itself (autocrine effect) or on short- or long-distant organs (paracrine/endocrine effects) and control processes such as metabolism, angiogenesis, or inflammation. Widely differing diseases ranging from genetic myopathies to cancers are emerging as causing dysregulated secretion of myokines from skeletal muscles. Myokines are also involved in the control of muscle size and may be important to be restored to normal levels to alleviate muscle wasting in various conditions, such as cancer, untreated diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aging, or heart failure. Interestingly, many myokines are induced by exercise (muscle-derived exerkines) and some even by specific types of physical activity, but more studies are needed on this issue. Most exercise-induced myokines travel throughout the body by means of extracellular vesicles. Restoring myokines by physical activity may be added to the list of mechanisms by which exercise exerts preventative or curative effects against a large number of diseases, including the deleterious muscle wasting they may cause. Extending our understanding about which myokines could be usefully restored in certain diseases might help in prescribing more tailored exercise or myokine-based drugs.

AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and highly lethal disease. As advanced treatment modalities are being developed, improved prognostication methods are sought. L3 skeletal muscle index (L3SMI) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are accepted surrogate markers of sarcopenia and related frailty. We aimed to evaluate the potential association of these markers with NSCLC patients' survival. Methods: A retrospective, single-center study of an NSCLC patients' cohort. L3SMI was calculated based on skeletal muscle area on computed tomography scans at the level of the L3 vertebra. Clinical data were extracted from clinical charts. Results: A total of 140 patients (56.4% males, median age 66 [range 37-86]) were included in this study, 32% were diagnosed at stage 3 and 45% at stage 4. During the follow-up duration (median of 1.9 years; range 1 month to 6.4 years), 102 patients (72.8%) died. Patients' characteristics that were found to be associated with increased mortality were performance status, albumin and tumor stage at diagnosis. Sarcopenia, defined as low L3SMI (lower than 41 cm2/m2 for women and lower than 53 cm2/m2 for men) was significantly associated with higher risk of mortality compared with patients with normal L3SMI values (77.2%, vs 64.6%, p=0.013) in univariate analysis, but not in a multiple regression analysis. Conclusion: Low L3SMI could serve as a surrogate marker for sarcopenia and frailty and, as such, facilitate the prognostication process of NSCLC patients.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by proximal limb muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased deep-tendon reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. There are 2 forms of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: one most frequently associated with small-cell lung cancer (P-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and the other that is a pure autoimmune form (NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a very rare disorder in children younger than age 12 years. Herein, we report a 25-year-old man with NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which onset was at the age of 10 years. To date, this is the most long-term follow-up of NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in childhood. In our patient, the only symptomatic treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate has been sufficient to guarantee him a good quality of life. Our data remind physicians to keep in mind the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in children with a proximal myopathic pattern and they confirm the specificity of compound muscle action potential incremental pattern after brief maximal effort in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, with an increasing rate in morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a greater awareness about the clinical importance of systemic effects and other chronic conditions associated with COPD, as these significantly impact on the course of disease. The most studied extrapulmonary manifestations in COPD include the presence of concomitant cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle wasting, osteoporosis and lung cancer. Anaemia is a recognised independent marker of mortality in several chronic diseases. Recent studies have shown that anaemia in patients with COPD may be more frequent than expected, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 33%. Some evidence suggests that systemic inflammation may play an important pathogenic role, but anaemia in COPD is probably multifactorial and may be caused by others factors, such as concealed chronic renal failure, decreased androgenic levels, iron depletion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and exacerbations. Low levels of haemoglobin and haematocrit in COPD patients have been associated with poor clinical and functional outcomes as well as with mortality and increased healthcare costs. Despite the potential clinical benefit of successfully treating anaemia in these patients, evidence supporting the importance of its correction on the prognosis of COPD is uncertain.

AB  - In two men presenting with muscle weakness and disturbances of equilibrium neurophysiological examination by repeated stimulations revealed responses suggestive of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. In the first month of the disease very high levels of anti-Hu antibody were found in the serum and CSF, betraying a malignant lesion. This was confirmed by autopsy 4 months later in one patient and by bronchial biopsy 16 months later in the other patient. Both had small-cell lung carcinoma associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting is considered the central feature of cachexia, but the potential for skeletal muscle anabolism in patients with advanced cancer is unproven., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical course of skeletal muscle wasting in advanced cancer and the window of possible muscle anabolism., DESIGN: We conducted a quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) images for the loss and gain of muscle in population-based cohorts of advanced cancer patients (lung, colorectal, and pancreas cancer and cholangiocarcinoma) in a longitudinal observational study., RESULTS: Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with >90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain., CONCLUSIONS: A window of anabolic potential exists at defined early phases of the disease trajectory (>90 d survival), creating an opportunity for nutritional intervention to stop or reverse cachexia. Cancer patients within 90 d of death have a low likelihood of anabolic potential.

AB  - Advanced cancer is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities that may lead to significant body composition changes, particularly muscle loss or sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in cancer has been associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poor physical function. Accurate tools to assess body composition are expensive and not readily available in clinical settings. Unfortunately, little is known about the efficacy of affordable and portable techniques to assess functional status in patients with cancer. We investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with different portable and low-cost functional status measurement tools (i.e., handgrip strength testing, a two-minute walking test, and a self-report questionnaire) in overweight/obese patients (body mass index >= 25 kg/m2) with advanced cancer. Twenty-eight patients (68% men) aged 64.5 +/- 9.5 years with advanced lung or colorectal cancer were included. Sarcopenia was assessed by measuring appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) adjusted by height (ASM index), using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Approximately 36% of patients had sarcopenia. Average handgrip strength was greater in men without sarcopenia than in men with it (p=0.035). In men, ASM index was positively correlated with average (r=0.535, p=0.018) and peak handgrip strength (r=0.457, p=0.049). No differences were observed among female patients. Handgrip strength was associated with sarcopenia in male patients with advanced cancer, and therefore it may be used as a portable and simple nutritional screening tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence on body composition suggests that sarcopenic obesity (obesity with depleted muscle mass) might be predictive of morbidity and mortality in non-malignant disease and also of toxicity to chemotherapy. We aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical implications of sarcopenic obesity in patients with cancer., METHODS: Between Jan 13, 2004, and Jan 19, 2007, 2115 patients with solid tumours of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract from a cancer treatment centre serving northern Alberta, Canada, were identified. Available lumbar CT images of the obese patients were analysed for total skeletal muscle cross-sectional area; these values were also used to estimate total body fat-free mass (FFM)., FINDINGS: Of the 2115 patients initially identified, 325 (15%) were classified as obese (body-mass index [BMI] > or =30). Of these obese patients, 250 had CT images that met the criteria for analysis. The remaining 75 patients were recorded as without assessable scans. Obese patients had a wide range of muscle mass. Sex-specific cut-offs that defined a significant association between low muscle mass with mortality were ascertained by optimum stratification analysis: 38 (15%) of 250 patients who had assessable CT images that met the criteria for analysis were below these cut-offs and were classified as having sarcopenia. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with poorer functional status compared with obese patients who did not have sarcopenia (p=0.009), and was an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.2 [95% CI 2.4-7.2], p<0.0001). Estimated FFM showed a poor association with body-surface area (r(2)=0.37). Assuming that FFM represents the volume of distribution of many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, we estimated that individual variation in FFM could account for up to three-times variation in effective volume of distribution for chemotherapy administered per unit body-surface area, in this population., INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence of the great variability of body composition in patients with cancer and links body composition, especially sarcopenic obesity, to clinical implications such as functional status, survival, and potentially, chemotherapy toxicity.

AB  - Adapting therapies and providing personalized care for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer represent major challenges. This involves integrating several parameters into the patient's management, not only crude pathologic results, but also a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tumor progression. Many studies have looked at the impact of host and tumor characteristics and their interactions through inflammatory processes or tumor immune environment. Beyond tumor stage, poor nutrition, sarcopenia and inflammatory state have been identified as independent factors that can directly impact postoperative outcome. The development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), in which patient becomes the main player in their own management, seems to be an interesting answer since it seems to allow a reduction in postoperative complications, length of stay and indirectly reduction in costs. A broader and more complete vision including morphometric evaluation of the patient, physical performances, inflammatory state and nutritional state would provide additional discriminating information which can predict postoperative outcome and help in adapting therapies in a personalized way.

AB  - Muscle dysfunction and wasting are predictors of mortality in advanced COPD and malignancies. Redox imbalance and enhanced protein catabolism are underlying mechanisms in COPD. We hypothesized that the expression profile of several biological markers share similarities in patients with cachexia associated with either COPD or lung cancer (LC). In vastus lateralis of cachectic patients with either LC (n=10) or advanced COPD (n=16) and healthy controls (n=10), markers of redox balance, inflammation, proteolysis, autophagy, signaling pathways, mitochondrial function, muscle structure, and sarcomere damage were measured using laboratory and light and electron microscopy techniques. Systemic redox balance and inflammation were also determined. All subjects were clinically evaluated. Compared to controls, in both cachectic groups of patients, a similar expression profile of different biological markers was observed in their muscles: increased levels of muscle protein oxidation and ubiquitination (p<0.05, both), which positively correlated (r=0.888), redox-sensitive signaling pathways (NF-kappaB and FoxO) were activated (p<0.05, all), fast-twitch fiber sizes were atrophied, muscle structural abnormalities and sarcomere disruptions were significantly greater (p<0.05, both). Structural and functional protein levels were lower in muscles of both cachectic patient groups than in controls (p<0.05, all). However, levels of autophagy markers including ultrastructural autophagosome counts were increased only in muscles of cachectic COPD patients (p<0.05). Systemic oxidative stress and inflammation levels were also increased in both patient groups compared to controls (p<0.005, both). Oxidative stress and redox-sensitive signaling pathways are likely to contribute to the etiology of muscle wasting and sarcomere disruption in patients with respiratory cachexia: LC and COPD.

AB  - Chronic inflammation is associated with cachexia-induced skeletal muscle mass loss in cancer. Levels of IL-6 cytokine family members are increased during cancer-related cachexia and induce intracellular signaling through glycoprotein130 (gp130). Although muscle STAT3 and circulating IL-6 are implicated in cancer-induced muscle wasting, there is limited understanding of muscle gp130's role in this process. Therefore, we investigated the role of skeletal muscle gp130 (skm-gp130) in cancer-induced alterations in the regulation of muscle protein turnover. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into 8-wk-old skm-gp130-knockout (KO) mice or wild-type mice. Skeletal muscle loss was attenuated by 16% in gp130-KO mice, which coincided with attenuated LLC-induced phosphorylation of muscle STAT3, p38, and FOXO3. gp130 KO did not restore mTOR inhibition or alter AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression. The induction of atrogin expression and p38 phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes exposed to LLC-treated medium was attenuated by gp130 inhibition, but mTOR inhibition was not restored. STAT signaling inhibition in LLC-treated myotubes did not attenuate the induction of p38 or AMPK phosphorylation. We concluded that, during LLC-induced cachexia, skm-gp130 regulates muscle mass signaling through STAT3 and p38 for the activation of FOXO3 and atrogin, but does not directly regulate the suppression of mTOR.

AB  - Background: Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone (Dex), are corticosteroids secreted by the adrenal gland, which are used as potent anti-inflammatory, anti-shock, and immunosuppressive agents. Dex is commonly used in patients with malignant tumors, such lung cancer. However, administration of high-dose Dex induces severe atrophy of the skeletal muscle, and the underlying mechanisms of this skeletal muscle atrophy remain unclear. Abundant miRNAs of skeletal muscle, such as miR-351, play an important role in the regulation of extenuating the process of muscle atrophy., Methods: The mRNA and protein expression of TRAF6, MuRF1, MAFbx was determined by real-time PCR and western blot, while the expression of miR-351 was detected by real-time PCR. The myotubes were transfected with miR-351 mimic, negative control, or miR-351 inhibitor. The C2C12 myotubes diameter was measured., Results: MicroRNA351 (miR-351) level was markedly reduced and the mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were increased in Dex-induced C2C12 myotube atrophy. miR-351 directly interacted with the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of TRAF6. Interestingly, miR-351 administration notably inhibited the reduction of the C2C12 myotube diameter induced by Dex treatment and reduced the levels of TRAF6, muscle-RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)., Conclusions: miR-351 counteracts Dex-induced C2C12 myotube atrophy by repressing the TRAF6 expression as well as E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 and MAFbx. miR-351 maybe a potential target for development of a new strategy for skeletal muscle atrophy.

AB  - The detailed postmortem laryngeal findings of a man with an established vocal cord palsy from an inoperable bronchial carcinoma is presented. Fine dissection of the monoblock specimen from skull base to superior mediastinum allowed sampling of vagus, recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves at different levels for fiber counts in order to compare the affected left and unaffected right side. Horizontal slicing of the whole larynx showed that the main cause of lateral displacement of the paralyzed left cord was gross atrophy of the underlying intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Cricothyroid muscle and superior laryngeal nerves were unaffected. Lateral cord drift due to underlying muscle atrophy is a better explanation of paralyzed cord position in this case than the Wagner and Grossmann theory of cord palsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Paraneoplastic syndromes consist of a group of disorders that are not related to the extension of the primary tumor or its metastases and that might be the first manifestation of a hidden neoplasm. It is a well-known association between dermatomyositis (DM) and cancer, especially gynecological tumors in women and lung cancer in men., METHODS: We describe the case of a 67-year-old male who developed muscular weakness and pruritic skin lesions. Skin biopsies were performed and histologic findings were consistent with DM., RESULTS: Skin biopsy showed interface dermatitis with vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, dermal mucin deposits, and necrotic keratinocytes in the acrosyringia, a finding that has been previously reported in lupus erythematous but not in DM. Autoimmunity tests showed positivity for antinuclear antibodies and anti-NXP2, a recently described antibody associated with juvenile DM and, more rarely, with paraneoplastic DM., CONCLUSION: We present the first case in the literature with histopathologic changes of DM affecting the acrosyringia. Besides, our patient autoimmunity results support the utility of the new myositis-specific autoantibodies and its relation with a clinical phenotype.

AB  - PURPOSE: Ongoing cancer cachexia trials evaluate sarcopenia by skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 vertebrae level, commonly used as a standard. Routine chest CT institutional protocols widely differ in including L3. We investigated whether SMI at L1 assessment, rather than L3, would be reliable and more practicable for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: NSCLC patients with routine CT chest had SMI measurements performed at L1 using Slice-O-Matic software. Accuracy of including L1 level, imaging quality, and ability to detect sarcopenia was collected and correlation of L1 SMI with body mass index (BMI) was performed., RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with NSCLC (73 CT assessments) were enlisted at three institutions. Characteristics: 47% female; medians: age 59, KPS 80%; BMI 25.49, weight 72.97 kg, SMI 59.24. Sarcopenia was detected in 14.7% of patients; 20% had sarcopenic obesity. Of the 73 CTs, 94.5% included L1 (95% CI 86.6-98.5%). Three images (4%) were difficult to evaluate. Inclusion of L1 was similar among the three participating institutions (90.4 to 96.7% inclusion). BMI correlation with SMI was weak (r = 0.329)., CONCLUSIONS: SMI assessment at L1 is achievable in patients with NSCLC receiving routine chest CT, with 96% having acceptable quality evaluations. Similar to results previously reported at L3, BMI showed poor correlation and low sensitivity to detect muscle mass loss. The use of CT at L1 is reliable and presents the opportunity for easier patient evaluation of sarcopenia in patients with lung cancer without the need for additional testing or radiation exposure.

AB  - Cachexia is characterized by inexorable muscle wasting that significantly affects patient prognosis and increases mortality. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of this muscle wasting is of significant importance. Recent work showed that components of the forkhead box O (FoxO) pathway are increased in skeletal muscle during cachexia. In the current study, we tested the physiological significance of FoxO activation in the progression of muscle atrophy associated with cachexia. FoxO-DNA binding dependent transcription was blocked in the muscles of mice through injection of a dominant negative (DN) FoxO expression plasmid prior to inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma cells or the induction of sepsis. Expression of DN FoxO inhibited the increased mRNA levels of atrogin-1, MuRF1, cathepsin L, and/or Bnip3 and inhibited muscle fiber atrophy during cancer cachexia and sepsis. Interestingly, during control conditions, expression of DN FoxO decreased myostatin expression, increased MyoD expression and satellite cell proliferation, and induced fiber hypertrophy, which required de novo protein synthesis. Collectively, these data show that FoxO-DNA binding-dependent transcription is necessary for normal muscle fiber atrophy during cancer cachexia and sepsis, and further suggest that basal levels of FoxO play an important role during normal conditions to depress satellite cell activation and limit muscle growth.

AB  - In a 12-year-old male shorthaired cat with attacks of hypokalaemic muscular weakness in spite of oral potassium supplementation, highly elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations in combination with low plasma renin activity pointed to primary hyperaldosteronism. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a large left-sided adrenal tumour growing into the phrenicoabdominal vein and the caudal vena cava. The tumour and its intravascular extension were surgically removed, but the subsequent stenosis of the caudal vena cava caused congestion and renal failure. At autopsy pulmonary micrometastases of the aldosteronoma were found.

AB  - Certain cancers exert unexplained remote effects on the nervous system. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, a tumour capable of spike electrogenesis and which is of possible neural crest origin, is present in approximately 70% of patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), a disorder characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. Patients with this syndrome have a defect in the (Ca2+-dependent) quantal release of acetylcholine from motor nerve terminals evoked by a nerve impulse or by high K+ (ref.5), and a decreased number of presynaptic active zone particles. The physiological and morphological features of the syndrome can be transferred to mice by the patients' IgG, consistent with an autoantibody interfering with the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Here we demonstrate that K+-induced 45Ca2+ flux in a cultured human SCC line is significantly reduced by LEMS IgG, suggesting that in SCC-LEMS an autoantibody to tumour Ca2+-channel determinants is triggered; its cross-reaction with similar determinants at the motor nerve terminal could lead to the remote neurological syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE: The metabolic changes associated with cachexia - sarcopenia syndrome might down-regulate antitumor immunity. We hypothesized that this syndrome reduces efficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: The records of 142 consecutive NSCLC patients receiving first- or second-line anti-Programmed cell death protein 1) ICPI were reviewed. Response evaluation according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was performed at the eighth week of immunotherapy. Pretreatment cachexia was defined as a body-weight loss of 5% or more in the previous 6 months. Sarcopenia was estimated with the third lumbar skeletal muscle mass index (mSMI) and was evaluated before immunotherapy and at the eighth week. A decrease by 5% or more of the mSMI was considered as an evolving sarcopenia. The endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression model and Cox model took into account others covariables known to influence ICPI efficiency, particularly Programmed Death -Ligand 1 tumor cell score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and common somatic mutational status., RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, cachexia - sarcopenia syndrome reduced the probability of achieving a disease control and were associated with a shorter survival. Patients without cachexia had a better probability to achieve disease control in comparison with those who did not experience cachexia (59.9 % and 41.1 %, respectively; odds ratio 95 % (confidence interval [95 %CI]): 2.60 (1.03-6.58)). Patients with cachexia had a shorter OS when compared with those without cachexia (hazard ratios [HR] (95 %CI): 6.26 (2.23-17.57)). Patients with an evolving sarcopenia had a shorter PFS and OS, with HR (95 %CI): 2.45 (1.09-5.53) and 3.87 (1.60-9.34) respectively., CONCLUSION: Cachexia - sarcopenia syndrome negatively influences patients' outcome during anti-PD-1 ICPI therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) refers to the presence of neoplastic cells in the pleural fluid and was previously associated with lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma. Patients with MPE effusion have significant symptoms, diminishing their overall quality of life but little is known about the influence sarcopenia may have on their clinical presentation., PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with MPE and its relationship with symptoms, health status, and the response to hospitalization., METHODS: Seventy-four patients with MPE underwent measurements of symptoms, health-related quality of life, and functional status upon admission, discharge, and 3 months after hospital discharge., RESULTS: Patients with MPE and sarcopenia were symptomatic during hospitalization and at discharge. Additionally, health-related quality of life and functional status were worse in patients with MPE and sarcopenia. All measures of patients with MPE and sarcopenia were significantly poorer 3 months after hospital discharge., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a clinical characteristic with substantial negative effects in patients with MPE. Specific interventions may need to be provided, designed, and offered in the clinical setting.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is associated with muscle weakness and atrophy. We investigated whether 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3), which has previously been shown to increase skeletal myoblast oxygen consumption rate, could reverse the deleterious effects of tumor cell conditioned medium on myoblast function. Conditioned medium from Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells inhibits oxygen consumption, increases mitochondrial fragmentation, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and enhances proteasomal activity in human skeletal muscle myoblasts. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 reverses the tumor cell-mediated changes in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and proteasomal activity, without changing pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 might be useful in treatment of weakness seen in association with CC.

AB  - Laryngeal carcinoma is rarely associated with paraneoplastic syndrome. Inflammatory myopathy presenting as paraneoplastic event is commonly associated with carcinomas of ovary, lung, pancreas, stomach, colorectal, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report a case of elderly male, who presented with proximal muscle weakness and found to be associated with laryngeal carcinoma. Diagnosis of polymyositis (PM) was confirmed based on clinical features, laboratory test, and muscle biopsy. Exclusion of other commonly associated malignancies was done. This patient improved gradually after 6 months of immunosuppressive therapy and management of underlying cancer.

AB  - A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital for dry cough and a mass in the hilum of the right lung on chest CT which was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer by bronchofiberscopy (T3N2M0, stage IIIB). Also, he was aware of progressive muscle weakness in the lower extremities on the first consultation. An electromyogram showed neuropathic changes and did not show waxing phenomenon in response to high frequency repetitive stimulation. Sensory nerve conduction velocity was low, so we diagnosed small cell cancer associated with paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy. Serum antineuronal antibodies were negative. His neurological symptoms improved dramatically after chemoradiotherapy for small cell lung cancer. A complete response was obtained by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation was administrated. He is alive without recurrence at 11 months after the treatment.

AB  - Antibodies against the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were recognized as the cause of myasthenia gravis in the 1970s'. Since then, other neurological disorders associated with autoantibodies have been identified, each associated with an antibody against a ligand- or voltage-gated ion channel. Autoantibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are detected in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). These antibodies interfere with the calcium-dependent release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane. LEMS is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, and is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, reduction of tendon reflex, and autonomic dysfunction. Electrophysiological examinations show small-amplitude compound muscle action potentials and increments on rapid repetitive nerve stimulation. Fifty to sixty percent of LEMS patients present with tumors, mostly small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), as a paraneoplastic syndrome. SCLC is a neuroendocrine tumor, which expresses neuronal VGCCs. Some patients present cerebellar ataxia, which is always accompanied by SCLC. These patients tend to show higher titers of VGCC antibodies than that by LEMS patients with no ataxia. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes at rest that shows increments greater than 100% with repetitive nerve stimulation and antibody detection by using radioimmunoprecipitation assays. The treatment options are generally categorized as anti-tumor, immunomodulating, immunosuppressing, and symptomatic treatments. In cases with SCLC, effective treatment against the tumor can improve LEMS. Plasmapheresis and intravenous administration of high-dose immunoglobulins have a short effect. Prednisone, alone or in combination with immunosuppressants can achieve long-term control of the disorder.

AB  - To assess the feasibility of treatments for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) showing a poor performance status (PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; ECOG 3 or 4), we retrospectively reviewed the outcome for 13 SCLC patients showing poor PS treated at the National Cancer Center Hospital between January 1984 and May 1994. The main factors which contributed to poor prognosis were superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, massive pleural effusion, tracheal stenosis due to lymph node swelling, pericardial effusion and pulmonary fibrosis (causing dyspnea in combination), brain metastasis resulting in neurological disturbance, cachexia, Eaton-Lambert syndrome causing muscle weakness, retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis causing abdominal pain, peritoneal effusion due to abdominal lymph node swelling, vertebral metastasis causing paraplegia, and dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM) causing muscle weakness. All of the patients received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The PS of 8 patients improved with treatment, but no improvement was seen in 5. We analyzed these 13 patients and considered the treatments for those with poor PS. Chemo-radiotherapy was tolerable in SCLC patients showing PS 3, and improved their PS if severe conditions or combined disease did not arise concurrently. It was further suggested that PS 4 patients with severe conditions or combined disease should not be given the treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting negatively impacts the progress of chronic diseases such as lung cancer (LC) and emphysema, which are in turn interrelated., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that muscle atrophy and body weight loss may develop in an experimental mouse model of lung carcinogenesis, that the profile of alterations in muscle fiber phenotype (fiber type composition and morphometry, muscle structural alterations, and nuclear apoptosis), and in muscle metabolism are similar in both respiratory and limb muscles of the tumor-bearing mice, and that the presence of underlying emphysema may influence those events., METHODS: Diaphragm and gastrocnemius muscles of mice with urethane-induced lung cancer (LC-U) with and without elastase-induced emphysema (E-U) and non-exposed controls (N = 8/group) were studied: fiber type composition, morphometry, muscle abnormalities, apoptotic nuclei (immunohistochemistry), and proteolytic and autophagy markers (immunoblotting) at 20- and 35-week exposure times. In the latter cohort, structural contractile proteins, creatine kinase (CK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) expression, oxidative stress, and inflammation were also measured. Body and muscle weights were quantified (baseline, during follow-up, and sacrifice)., RESULTS: Compared to controls, in U and E-U mice, whole body, diaphragm and gastrocnemius weights were reduced. Additionally, both in diaphragm and gastrocnemius, muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were smaller, structural abnormalities, autophagy and apoptotic nuclei were increased, while levels of actin, myosin, CK, PPARs, and antioxidants were decreased, and muscle proteolytic markers did not vary among groups., CONCLUSIONS: In this model of lung carcinogenesis with and without emphysema, reduced body weight gain and muscle atrophy were observed in respiratory and limb muscles of mice after 20- and 35-week exposure times most likely through increased nuclear apoptosis and autophagy. Underlying emphysema induced a larger reduction in the size of slow- and fast-twitch fibers in the diaphragm of U and E-U mice probably as a result of the greater inspiratory burden imposed onto this muscle.

AB  - Identification of to what extent tumor burden influences muscle mass independently of specific treatments for cancer-cachexia remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that reduced tumor burden by selective treatment of tumor with immunomodulators may exert beneficial effects on muscle wasting and function in mice. Body and muscle weight, grip strength, physical activity, muscle morphometry, apoptotic nuclei, troponin-I systemic levels, interleukin-6, proteolytic markers, and tyrosine release, and apoptosis markers were determined in diaphragm and gastrocnemius muscles of lung cancer (LP07 adenocarcinoma cells) mice (BALB/c) treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), against immune check-points and pathways (CD-137, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programed cell death-1, and CD-19; N = 10/group). Nontreated lung cancer cachectic mice were the controls. T and B cell numbers and macrophages were counted in tumors of both mouse groups. Compared to nontreated cachectic mice, in the mAbs-treated animals, T cells increased, no differences in B cells or macrophages, the variables final body weight, body weight and grip strength gains significantly improved. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of mAbs-treated cachectic mice, number of apoptotic nuclei, tyrosine release, proteolysis, and apoptosis markers significantly decreased compared to nontreated cachectic mice. Systemic levels of troponin-I significantly decreased in treated cachectic mice compared to nontreated animals. We conclude that reduced tumor burden as a result of selective treatment of the lung cancer cells with immunomodulators elicits per se beneficial effects on muscle mass loss through attenuation of several biological mechanisms that lead to increased protein breakdown and apoptosis, which translated into significant improvements in limb muscle strength but not in physical activity parameters.

AB  - Background: Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used in clinical research for single-slice assessment of muscle mass to correlate with clinical outcome and evaluate treatment efficacy. The third lumbar level (L3) is considered as reference for muscle, but chest scans generally do not reach beyond the first lumbar level (L1). This study investigates if pectoralis muscle and L1 are appropriate alternatives for L3., Methods: CT scans of 115 stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients were analyzed before and during tumor therapy. Skeletal muscle assessed at pectoralis and L1 muscle was compared to L3 at baseline. Furthermore, the prognostic significance of changes in muscle mass determined at different locations was investigated., Results: Pearson's correlation coefficient between skeletal muscle at L3 and L1 was stronger (r=0.90, P<0.001) than between L3 and pectoralis muscle (r=0.71, P<0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed that L3 (HR 0.943, 95% CI: 0.92-0.97, P<0.001) and L1 muscle loss (HR 0.954, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P<0.001) predicted overall survival, whereas pectoralis muscle loss did not., Conclusion: L1 is a better alternative than pectoralis muscle to substitute L3 for analysis of muscle mass from regular chest CT scans.

AB  - Cachexia and muscle wasting are well recognized as common and partly reversible features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adversely affecting disease progression and prognosis. This argues for integration of weight and muscle maintenance in patient care. In this review, recent insights are presented in the diagnosis of muscle wasting in COPD, the pathophysiology of muscle wasting, and putative mechanisms involved in a disturbed energy balance as cachexia driver. We discuss the therapeutic implications of these new insights for optimizing and personalizing management of COPD-induced cachexia.

AB  - A 58-year-old man presented with a two-month history of facial erythema and dry cough. Physical examination revealed typical cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis (DM), including heliotrope rash and shawl sign. A chest X-ray revealed a 4-cm mass in the right middle lung. After bronchoscopy and investigation of auto-antibodies, he was diagnosed with co-occurring transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma) positive DM and lung adenocarcinoma. He was administered oral prednisolone for subsequent muscle weakness, but developed TIF1-gamma positive DM-associated oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by spontaneous oesophageal rupture and died from progression of chemoresistant lung cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumor that has an epithelioid and histiocytoid appearance, originates from vascular endothelial or pre-endothelial cells and comprises less than 1% of all vascular tumors. It was described for the first time in 1975 as pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, because initially it was believed to be an aggressive form of bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma with a remarkable propensity to invade adjacent blood vessels and small airways. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature to date. Tumor cells expressing Fli-1 and CD31 have been identified as relatively specific endothelial markers. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may affect multiple organs and may vary considerably in its clinical and radiological presentation. More than 50% to 76% of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma patients are asymptomatic. They are usually incidentally diagnosed on the basis of abnormal chest radiography during routine physical examinations. Hematologic and gastrointestinal disorders and weakness or numbness may also be observed, in addition to respiratory symptoms, in cases of disseminated pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Pain and swelling, pathological fractures, spine compression or paresthesia, loss of muscular strength and paraplegia may be present when bone metastases occur. Because of the rarity of this disease, there is no standard for treatment., CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our institution in November 2009 with metastases of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma from the L3 and L4 vertebrae. A course of radiotherapy at a dosage of 3,000 cGy delivered in individual doses of 200 cGy/day for 5 days/wk to the L3 and L4 vertebrae led to the disappearance of the patient's lumbar pain without any detectable side effects. Percussion of the patient's vertebral spine was negative, and no radiological progression of bone disease was found at her 1-year follow-up examination., CONCLUSION: Since epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was first correctly defined, several research groups have reported their experiences with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma irradiation. Further studies are needed to establish a standard radiation dose to be used for such a complex and extremely rare disease. In our present case, a radiotherapy dosage of 3,000 cGy delivered in individual doses 200 cGy/day for 5 days/wk allowed us to reach our goals: local pain control with good tolerance and better quality of life by the 1-year follow-up examination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion is a less common cause of Cushing syndrome and is seen in 5 to 10% of cases with endogenous hypercortisolemia. We hereby describe our experience of patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, who have been managed over the past 10 years at a tertiary care center in Southern India., METHODS: The inpatient and outpatient records of patients from 2006 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical features, clinical history, biochemical values, imaging features, including radiologic findings and positron emission tomography scans, management, details of follow-up, and outcomes, were documented. We compared the biochemical findings in these patients with 20 consecutive patients with Cushing disease (Cushing syndrome of pituitary origin)., RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were studied. The median age at presentation was 34 years (range, 19 to 55 years). Seven patients had thymic carcinoid, 7 had bronchial carcinoid, 3 had lung malignancies, 2 had medullary carcinoma thyroid, 1 patient had a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and 1 patient had an occult source of ACTH. The most common clinical features at presentation were muscle weakness (95%), hyperpigmentation (90%), facial puffiness (76%), easy bruising (61%), edema (57%), and striae (52%). Extensive acne was seen in a large number of patients (43%). Only 3 patients (14%) had central obesity. The median 8 am cortisol was 55.5 mug/dL (range, 3.8 to 131 mug/dL), median 8 am ACTH was 207 pg/mL (range, 31.1 to 703 pg/mL), and the median 24-hour urinary free cortisol was 2,484 mug (range, 248 to 25,438 mug). Basal cortisol and ACTH, as well as midnight cortisol and ACTH level, were markedly higher in patients with ectopic Cushing syndrome as compared to patients with Cushing disease. Twelve of 21 patients had developed life-threatening infections by follow-up. Nine patients had undergone surgical intervention to address the primary tumor. However, only 1 patient exhibited a complete cure on follow-up., CONCLUSION: In our series, ectopic Cushing syndrome was most commonly seen in association with intrathoracic tumors such as bronchial or thymic carcinoid. Hyperpigmentation and proximal myopathy were frequent, while central obesity was uncommon. Early and rapid control of hypercortisolemia was important in order to prevent life-threatening infections and metabolic complications., ABBREVIATIONS: ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone CT = computed tomography DOTATATE = 68Ga-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate ECS = ectopic Cushing syndrome FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose MTC = medullary thyroid cancer NET = neuroendocrine tumor PET = positron emission tomography.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease involving both upper and lower motor neurons and the pathogenesis of this disorder is still unknown. To date, few reports have suggested that motor neuron diseases may have a paraneoplastic origin. However, it is still under discussion whether ALS occurring in cancer patients is paraneoplastic. A 60-year-old man with rectal cancer (Stage IV) having multiple lung, liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases underwent anterior resection of the rectum as palliative surgery. He was referred to our hospital for adjuvant chemotherapy. Lung and lymph node metastases decreased after 2 courses of chemotherapy using CPT-11 and 5-FU/LV but liver metastases were enlarged, following up increase in CEA. Thereafter, he suffered from muscle weakness in hands, arms, and legs and results of neurophysiologic studies were compatible with primary lateral sclerosis (ALS). For second line chemotherapy, he was treated with low-dose CDDP/5-FU over 6 courses. As a result, the size the of metastatic lesions markedly reduced and CEA was decreased to the normal level. Although significant tumor reduction was observed, his neurological symptoms rapidly progressed. He died of aspiration pneumonia 8 months after onset of the disease. Autopsy revealed that his neuropathological findings were compatible with ALS, and it was thought to be the primary cause of death in the because of absence of cancer progression. In this case the neurological syndrome was not affected by cancer therapy. Thus our case does not support the hypothesis that ALS in associated with cancer and the relationship between both disorders remains uncertain.

AB  - A 60-year-old Japanese male presented with swelling of bilateral cervical lymph nodes was subsequently diagnosed as the late stage of primary small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). He was then treated with cisplatin and irinotecan as first-line chemotherapy, but hypokalemia with muscle weakness of the bilateral legs became gradually noticeable following two months of effective chemotherapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of bilateral adrenal glands and abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes, though primary lung tumor remained the same in size. An ectopic ACTH-producing syndrome (EAS) was subsequently revealed by the following endocrinological studies. Hypokalemia was clinically improved by the treatment with metyrapone and the second-line chemotherapy with amrubicin for SCLC was started, but the patient died 12 days after the second-line chemotherapy. Post-mortem examination revealed ACTH immunoreactivity in tumor cells of all the metastatic lesions. Non-neoplastic adrenal cortex demonstrated hyperplasia associated with lipid depletion and marked expression of steroidogenic enzymes, especially in cortical cells around tumor infiltration, suggestive of paracrine ACTH stimulation of cortisol production. This is the first report evaluating expression of steroidogenic enzymes in adrenal cortex especially adjacent to the adrenal metastasis in the patients with EAS due to SCLC. These findings suggest that ACTH producing adrenal metastasis can induce EAS more frequently and severely, and that the symptoms and examination of EAS should be monitored carefully in the patients with adrenal metastasis of SCLC.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome was diagnosed in three patients, two men aged 55 and 57 and one woman aged 66 years. After a variable time interval a small cell carcinoma of the lung was detected in all three patients. Two already had metastases outside the thorax and died, the other patient was doing well after treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The short survival of patients with a small cell carcinoma requires early diagnosis, and paraneoplastic phenomena such as the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome can be the earliest presenting sign. The syndrome can be diagnosed by electromyography.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prognosis for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer remains poor. This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of maintenance sunitinib after platinum-etoposide chemotherapy., METHODS: Patients who demonstrated objective tumor response or stable disease after four cycles of platinum plus etoposide chemotherapy were eligible. Sunitinib was given at 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate from initiation of sunitinib., RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled. Responses to platinum-etoposide were complete response (CR)/partial response (PR)/stable disease (SD) = 3/11/2. The median number of weeks on sunitinib was 4 (range: 1.4-20). Reasons for sunitinib discontinuation were disease progression (50%), toxicity (31%), and patient request (19%). Median PFS from the start of sunitinib was 2.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-3.1). Further accrual would have failed to reach the target PFS rate, so the study was terminated. There were no objective responses to sunitinib, but four patients (25%) had disease stability for 15, 15, 17, and 20 weeks. Median PFS and overall survival from the start of chemotherapy were 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.1-6.5) and 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.2-14.7), respectively. Grade 3 to grade 4 toxicity included thrombocytopenia (25%), fatigue (19%), muscle weakness (13%), and hypothyroidism (6%)., CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib did not seem to maintain disease stability after response to chemotherapy. Sunitinib was discontinued in half of patients due to toxicity or request to stop therapy. Although disease stability with sunitinib was noted in four patients, this approach does not seem to warrant further clinical study.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder that is related to the loss of functional P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) on presynaptic nerve terminals. Up to 60% of cases occur as a paraneoplastic disorder (SCLC-LEMS), most commonly in association with small cell lung cancer. The remaining cases have an idiopathic non-tumor etiology but are associated with underlying autoimmune disease (NT-LEMS). Patients with LEMS invariably experience progressive proximal muscle weakness, often accompanied by general fatigue and autonomic symptoms. Some LEMS clinical symptoms overlap with those of other myasthenic syndromes, most commonly myasthenia gravis, which can contribute to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Prognosis is related to the presence of cancer or autoimmune disease and the severity/distribution of muscle weakness. Cause of death in patients with SCLC-LEMS is typically tumor progression, whereas NT-LEMS does not reduce life expectancy. LEMS diagnosis is supported by a threefold approach: clinical features, electromyography, and anti-VGCC antibody serology. LEMS is a clinically important early indicator of possible cancer; therefore, a LEMS diagnosis should immediately prompt rigorous oncological screening and surveillance. Symptomatic treatment of LEMS typically involves medications that improve neurotransmission (e.g., the potassium channel blocker amifampridine [3,4-diaminopyridine]), with addition of immunosuppressants/modulators (e.g., prednisone plus azathioprine) in individuals with persistent symptoms. Where a tumor is identified, oncological treatment should take priority. It should be remembered, however, that LEMS has a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and ability to perform daily activities, and therefore warrants timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment in and of itself.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the inflammatory myopathy associated with programmed cell death 1 inhibitors (PD-1 myopathy)., METHODS: We studied 19 Japanese patients with PD-1 myopathy (13 men and 6 women, mean age 70 years), who were referred to Keio University. As control groups, we used 68 patients with anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, 51 patients with anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies and 460 healthy subjects., RESULTS: In regard to muscle-disease severity, 10 patients showed a mild form of disease and 9 patients showed a severe form. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common underlying cancer. PD-1 inhibitor consisted of 11 nivolumab and 8 pembrolizumab. PD-1 myopathy occurred 29 days on average after the first administration of PD-1 inhibitor. The initial manifestation of muscle weakness was ptosis in 10 patients, 15 patients had ptosis, 13 diplopia, 8 facial muscle weakness, 10 bulbar symptoms, 13 limb weakness, 14 neck weakness, 4 cardiac involvement, 6 respiratory involvement and 16 myalgia. Ocular, facial, cardiac and respiratory involvement and myalgia were more frequently observed than controls. Serum creatine kinase was increased to 5247 IU/L on average. Autoantibodies related to inflammatory myopathy were negative, while anti-striational antibodies were found in 13 (68%) patients. HLA-C*12:02 alleles were more frequently detected than healthy controls. Muscle pathology was characterized by multifocal necrotic myofibers with endomysial inflammation and expression of MHC class I. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids was generally effective for muscle weakness., CONCLUSIONS: Based on our clinical, histological and immunological findings, PD-1 myopathy is a discrete subset of inflammatory myopathy.

AB  - Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous group of rare autoimmune diseases characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and inflammatory infiltrates on muscle biopsy. A meticulously collected combination of clinical, serological, and pathological data is essential to correctly diagnose and classify myositis patients, often a considerable challenge for clinicians. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the most useful tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with myositis. Capillaroscopy, serological biomarkers (particularly the autoantibody profile) and imaging techniques, such as muscle magnetic resonance and chest ultrasound, are of great aid in diagnosing, classifying and managing these patients. Relevant clinical scenarios, such as interstitial lung disease, associated cancer and pregnancy are also addressed in this review. Myositis registries, identification of new autoantibodies, and genetic studies will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions and help to define new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic surgery is a common technique used for the treatment of disk herniation and spinal stenosis. In this report, we present a patient who underwent percutaneous endoscopic decompression due to spinal metastasis., CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old female patient with a known diagnosis of lung cancer presented to our clinic with a 10-day history of severe pain in the left leg and a 5-day history of muscle weakness in the left thigh. The patient had a history of multiple organ metastasis and multiple spinal metastasis. On neurologic examination, left hip flexion and extension were graded 2/5. Radiologic workup revealed compression on the left L3 nerve root caused by vertebral metastasis. The patient was planned for a percutaneous full-endoscopic interlaminar decompression due to her clinical condition. The tumor surrounding the left L3 nerve root was removed via endoscopic punch, which resulted in rapid relief of her back pain postoperatively. Adjunct physical therapy was recommended after discharge., CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous full-endoscopic interlaminar decompression can be an alternative minimally invasive treatment option in selected patients with radicular pain and neurologic deficit caused by spinal metastasis.

AB  - Hepatic carcinoid tumors are very uncommon; most are clinically non-functional and very few present with the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. ACTH-producing carcinoid tumors most commonly originate in the lung or thymus and present insidiously with bronchospasm and/or chest mass. Occasionally, ectopic ACTH syndromes have been reported in association with pancreatic islet cell tumors, medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, and rarely, ovarian and prostate tumors. We report here a patient with an ectopic ACTH-secreting primary hepatic carcinoid tumor who presented with cushingoid appearance, profound proximal muscle weakness, severe lower extremity edema, and markedly elevated urinary free cortisol. ACTH levels were in the low normal range. A solitary vascular hepatic lesion was found on magnetic resonance imaging, which was isodense with the surrounding liver on octreotide scan and photopenic on an 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Following surgical resection of the hepatic tumor, histopathology confirmed an ACTH-secreting neuroendocrine tumor (NET), the patient had complete resolution of hypercortisolemic symptoms and remains in remission, now 4 yr after hepatic tumor resection. This case reports the first ACTH-secreting primary hepatic NET presenting as ectopic Cushing's syndrome. Interesting aspects of this case include the presence of a pituitary incidentaloma, the low normal ACTH, and photopenia on 18FDG-PET imaging.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer type in which the mortality rate approaches the incidence rate. More than 85% of PDAC patients experience a profound loss of muscle mass and function, known as cachexia. PDAC patients with this condition suffer from decreased tolerance to anti-cancer therapies and often succumb to premature death due to respiratory and cardiac muscle wasting. Yet, there are no approved therapies available to alleviate cachexia. We previously found that upregulation of the metal ion transporter, Zip14, and altered zinc homeostasis are critical mediators of cachexia in metastatic colon, lung, and breast cancer models. Here, we show that a similar mechanism is likely driving the development of cachexia in PDAC. In two independent experimental metastasis models generated from the murine PDAC cell lines, Pan02 and FC1242, we observed aberrant Zip14 expression and increased zinc ion levels in cachectic muscles. Moreover, in advanced PDAC patients, high levels of ZIP14 in muscles correlated with the presence of cachexia. These studies underscore the importance of altered ZIP14 function in PDAC-associated cachexia development and highlight a potential therapeutic opportunity for improving the quality of life and prolonging survival in PDAC patients.

AB  - A male patient with muscle weakness had clinical findings of ptosis, diplopia, proximal leg weakness, and positive repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test. He demonstrated positive acetylcholine receptor antibody. This lung cancer patient was presenting myasthenia gravis. The causal association between non-small-cell lung cancer and non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis has not been clarified yet. To date, there has been no evidence supporting the speculation that association of myasthenia gravis with lung cancer might be one of the phenotypes of paraneoplastic syndrome.

AB  - Tubulin is the major protein of microtubules. The immunocytochemical distribution of tubulin within the human respiratory tract has not been investigated in detail and no analysis of diseased lung or lung tumours has been undertaken. We therefore studied the distribution of beta-tubulin in formalin-fixed normal lung (n = 6), cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (n = 10) and lung tumours (n = 66), using a monoclonal antibody to beta-tubulin. In normal lung positive immunostaining was observed in all ciliated epithelium from the trachea down to bronchiolar level; blood vessel endothelium, vascular smooth muscle and nerve bundles were also strongly positive; pneumocytes, cartilage and airway smooth muscle gave weak staining. A similar distribution of beta-tubulin was seen in cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, but with strong tubulin immunostaining of fibroblasts in the interstitium and of the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelial cells. In lung tumours, six of 17 (35%) adenocarcinomas, one of two adenosquamous and one of 17 (5%) squamous cell carcinomas gave strong immunostaining. All six large cell carcinomas gave strong immunostaining for tubulin. In neuroendocrine tumours, two of seven (28%) carcinoids, two of seven (28%) atypical carcinoids and seven of 10 (70%) small cell carcinomas were strongly positive for tubulin. beta-Tubulin is widely distributed in the normal and diseased respiratory tract and is found in many lung tumours, particularly in large cell and small cell carcinomas which are highly aggressive in behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to cancer progression, and several inflammatory markers have been reported to be associated with the clinical outcomes in patients with various types of cancer. Recently, the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) has been developed as a prognostic marker in patients with lung cancer. The difference between the ALI and the inflammatory markers reported in the previous studies is that the ALI contains not only indices related to inflammation but also the body mass index (BMI), which was reported to correlate with the sarcopenic status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the ALI in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 159 patients who underwent combination chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer between 2008 and 2016. The BMI was calculated by dividing the weight by height squared. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated from a blood sample by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. The ALI was defined as follows: ALI=BMI x serum albumin concentration/NLR., RESULTS: The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the low-ALI group than in the high-ALI group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the ALI was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.773, 95% confidence interval: 1.773-4.335, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A newly developed prognostic marker, the ALI, was found to be a novel prognostic marker in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer as well as in patients with lung cancer.

AB  - A 70-year-old male was referred to our hospital with lower limb muscle weakness and numbness of the left hand. The patient had previously been diagnosed seven years ago with lung cancer accompanied by central airway obstruction and had received chemoradiotherapy following placement of a metallic stent. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an osteolytic lesion which was adjacent to the fractured stent. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated high signal intensity in the disc space. The patient was diagnosed with spondylodiscitis and spinal epidural abscess related to the airway stent. Despite hemilaminectomy, laminectomy and long-term antibiotic therapy, the infection was uncontrolled. Moreover, osteolytic destruction and kyphotic deformity progressed. Removal of the airway stent was necessary; however, it was impossible because bronchial resection was required and the risk of mediastinal injury was considered to be high. The patient subsequently received palliative care. Long-term airway stenting can cause spondylodiscitis and spinal epidural abscess. Indications for the placement of metallic stents for malignant central airway obstruction should be carefully evaluated after considering the difficulty in removal and the long-term risk of severe complications. KEY POINTS: Significant findings of the study Long-term placement and fracture of the airway stent can cause spondylodiscitis and spinal epidural abscess. What this study adds The indication of placement of a metallic stent for malignant central airway obstruction should be considered with caution, especially if long-term survival can be expected.

AB  - Transplantation of stem cell-derived myoblasts is a promising approach for the treatment of skeletal muscle function loss. Myoblasts directly converted from somatic cells that bypass any stem cell intermediary stages can avoid the problem of tumor formation after transplantation. Previously, we reported that co-transduction with the myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1) gene and the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene lung carcinoma derived homolog (MYCL) gene efficiently converted human fibroblasts into myoblasts. Although the directly converted myoblasts efficiently fused into multinucleated myotubes in vitro and in vivo, it is not clear whether they have the contractile ability, which is the most significant phenotype of the muscle. In the present study, we aimed to examine the in vitro contractile ability of the myotubes differentiated from the directly converted myoblasts by the overexpression of MYOD1 and MYCL. We fabricated three-dimensional (3D) tissues on a microdevice for force measurement. The 3D culture enhanced the differentiation of the myoblasts into myotubes, which were confirmed by gene expression analysis of skeletal muscle-related genes. The tissues started to generate contractile force in response to electrical stimulation after 4 days of culture, which reached approximately 12 muN after 10 days. The addition of IGF-I decreased the contractile force of the 3D tissues, while the use of cryopreserved cells increased it. We confirmed that the tissues fabricated from the cells derived from three different donors generated forces of similar magnitude. Thus, directly converted myoblasts by the overexpression of MYOD1 and MYCL could be a promising cell source for cell therapy. Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Didemnin B (NSC 325319), a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from a Carribean sea tunicate, exhibited potent antitumor activity in preclinical studies. After determining the maximum tolerated dose in our previous phase I/II trial, we conducted a phase II study of this drug in patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer; the starting dose was 6.3 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 min every 28 days. The major side effects were in the neuromuscular system and included severe muscle weakness, myopathy and/or myotonia by electromyography, and elevation of creatine phosphokinase and aldolase levels. We also observed modest increases in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. There were minimal hematologic toxic effects. No response was observed among 15 evaluable patients, leading us to conclude that didemnin B was toxic but inactive in patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer at the stated dose and schedule. A review of the literature revealed no significant antitumor activity in cancers of the colon, breast, ovaries, cervix, or lung (non-small cell) or in renal cell carcinoma. Further clinical trials for didemnin B may not be warranted at the stated dose and schedule.

AB  - We here reported a 54-year-old female patient with Crow-Fukase syndrome associated with pulmonary plasmacytoma. She was found to have scattered tumor in 1990. Although the tumor had slowly grown for the last 10 years, she showed no clinical symptoms. Numbness and weakness of lower extremities began in June 1999, and she was referred to Kyoto University Hospital on Oct. 21 1999 for evaluation of progressive symptoms. She had skin pigmentation, edema of the lower extremities, lymphadenopathy, muscle weakness and sensory disturbance in a glove-and-stocking distribution. Serological examination showed monoclonal IgG-lambda gammopathy. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was markedly elevated. Microscopic studies on biopsied sural nerve demonstrated mild decrease of myelinated fibers. Immunohistochemically, the pulmonary tumor was defined as an IgG (lambda type) plasmacytoma. After treatment with melphalan-prednisolone therapy, the neurological symptoms improved along with decrease of serum VEGF levels as well as the size of pulmonary plasmacytoma. This is the first report of a patient with Crow-Fukase syndrome associated with pulmonary plasmacytoma. This case suggests that growth of pulmonary plasmacytoma might have played an important role in the overproduction of VEGF and thus development of Crow-Fukase syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia influences overall survival (OS) and tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the impact of postoperative complications and the outcome of limited surgery have not been highlighted. Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on surgical outcomes., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included NSCLC patients who had undergone lung cancer resection between 2007 and 2017. Sarcopenia was confirmed based on computed tomography of the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the third lumbar vertebra level. We used propensity score-matched analysis to elucidate the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative complications and limited surgery., RESULTS: A total of 391 patients were enrolled, including 198 sarcopenic patients. Multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor associated with OS and recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 3.33, P < 0.001; HR, 2.76, P < 0.001, respectively]. Regarding the incidence of postoperative complications, there was no difference between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients (69/198 versus 55/193, P = 0.19). After propensity score matching, among patients without sarcopenia, the 5-year OS was lower in those with limited surgery than in those with standard surgery (70.7% vs. 96.4%, P = 0.011). In contrast, among sarcopenic patients, there was no difference in the 5-year OS between patients with limited surgery and those with standard surgery (53.2% vs. 60.7%, P = 0.66)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a prognostic predictor for poor OS and may contribute to the selection of limited surgery for sarcopenic patients. Preoperative assessment of sarcopenia may provide clinically important information.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune channelopathy in which patients produce autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels. LEMS is paraneoplastic in 50% of patients, most frequently associated with small cell lung carcinoma. We describe a case of paraneoplastic LEMS associated with a vocal cord carcinoma., OBSERVATION: A 64-year-old man developed in five months muscle weakness affecting gait. Clinical examination showed proximal muscular deficiency, areflexia and dysphonia. Electrophysiologic study showed potentiation greater than 500% after post exercise facilitation and 76 percent increment response at high-rate repetitive nerve stimulation (20Hz). Diagnosis of LEMS was confirmed by electrophysiologic study and anti-voltage gated calcium channel antibodies (90pM, positive value greater or equal to 70pM). Left vocal cord lesion histology showed epidermoid carcinoma. A combination of vocal cord tumor removal by endoscopy and treatment by pyridostigmine, 3-4 diaminopyridine and intravenous human immunoglobulin improved neurological symptoms., CONCLUSION: Paraneoplastic syndromes in association with cancers of the larynx and hypopharynx are unusual. Only two cases are reported with LEMS associated with larynx carcinoma. We describe an unusual case of LEMS associated with a left vocal cord carcinoma.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical impact of sarcopenia on the efficacy of programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between January 2016 and September 2018 for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on baseline computed tomography was assessed to calculate the psoas muscle index (PMI). Sarcopenia was defined based on PMI cut-off values for Asian adults (6.36 cm2/m2 for males and 3.92 cm2/m2 for females). A total of 42 patients were analysed. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 52.4%. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 2.1 vs. 6.8 months, p = 0.004). Compared to patients with sarcopenia, those without sarcopenia had a higher overall response rate (40.0% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.025) and 1-year PFS rate (38.1% vs. 10.1%). In conclusion, sarcopenia at baseline as determined using computed tomography is a significant predictor of worse outcome in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PD-1 blockade. Screening for sarcopenia may help identify patients more likely to achieve a long-term response in routine clinical practice.

AB  - Cachexia occurs in patients with advanced cancers. Despite the adverse clinical impact of cancer-induced muscle wasting, pathways causing cachexia are controversial, and clinically reliable therapies are not available. A trigger of muscle protein loss is the Jak/Stat pathway, and indeed, we found that conditioned medium from C26 colon carcinoma (C26) or Lewis lung carcinoma cells activates Stat3 (p-Stat3) in C2C12 myotubes. We identified two proteolytic pathways that are activated in muscle by p-Stat3; one is activation of caspase-3, and the other is p-Stat3 to myostatin, MAFbx/Atrogin-1, and MuRF-1 via CAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta). Using sequential deletions of the caspase-3 promoter and CHIP assays, we determined that Stat3 activation increases caspase-3 expression in C2C12 cells. Caspase-3 expression and proteolytic activity were stimulated by p-Stat3 in muscles of tumor-bearing mice. In mice with cachexia caused by Lewis lung carcinoma or C26 tumors, knock-out of p-Stat3 in muscle or with a small chemical inhibitor of p-Stat3 suppressed muscle mass losses, improved protein synthesis and degradation in muscle, and increased body weight and grip strength. Activation of p-Stat3 stimulates a pathway from C/EBPdelta to myostatin and expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and increases the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, C/EBPdelta KO decreases the expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and myostatin, while increasing muscle mass and grip strength. In conclusion, cancer stimulates p-Stat3 in muscle, activating protein loss by stimulating caspase-3, myostatin, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These results could lead to novel strategies for preventing cancer-induced muscle wasting. Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - C/EBPbeta is a key mediator of cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. However, the signaling mechanisms that activate C/EBPbeta in the cancer milieu are poorly defined. Here, we report cancer-induced muscle wasting requires the transcriptional cofactor p300, which is critical for the activation of C/EBPbeta. Conditioned media from diverse types of tumor cells as well as recombinant HSP70 and HSP90 provoked rapid acetylation of C/EBPbeta in myotubes, particularly at its Lys39 residue. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta with mutated Lys39 impaired Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-induced activation of the C/EBPbeta-dependent catabolic response, which included upregulation of E3 ligases UBR2 and atrogin1/MAFbx, increased LC3-II, and loss of muscle proteins both in myotubes and mouse muscle. Silencing p300 in myotubes or overexpressing a dominant negative p300 mutant lacking acetyltransferase activity in mouse muscle attenuated LLC tumor-induced muscle catabolism. Administration of pharmacologic p300 inhibitor C646, but not PCAF/GCN5 inhibitor CPTH6, spared LLC tumor-bearing mice from muscle wasting. Furthermore, mice with muscle-specific p300 knockout were resistant to LLC tumor-induced muscle wasting. These data suggest that p300 is a key mediator of LLC tumor-induced muscle wasting whose acetyltransferase activity may be targeted for therapeutic benefit in this disease. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that tumor-induced muscle wasting in mice is abrogated by knockout, mutation of Lys39 or Asp1399, and pharmacologic inhibition of p300.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent research indicates that severe muscular depletion (sarcopenia) is frequent in cancer patients and linked to cachexia and poor survival. Our aim was to investigate if measures of skeletal muscle hold prognostic information in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: We included NSCLC patients with disease stage IIIB/IV, performance status 0-2, enrolled in three randomised trials of first-line chemotherapy (n = 1305). Computed tomography (CT) images obtained before start of treatment were used for body composition analyses at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by measures of the cross sectional muscle area, from which the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was obtained. Skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) was measured as the mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of the measured muscle area. A high level of mean HU indicates a high SMD., RESULTS: Complete data were available for 734 patients, mean age 65 years. Both skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle radiodensity (SMD) varied largely. Mean SMI and SMD were 47.7 cm2/m2 and 37.4 HU in men (n = 420), 39.6 cm2/m2 and 37.0 HU in women (n = 314). Multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusted for established prognostic factors, showed that SMD was independently prognostic for survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.001), whereas SMI was not (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.01, p = 0.329)., CONCLUSION: Low SMD is associated with poorer survival in advanced NSCLC. Further research is warranted to establish whether muscle measures should be integrated into routine practice to improve prognostic accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a syndrome of weight loss (including muscle and fat), anorexia, and decreased physical function. It has been suggested that the optimal treatment for cachexia should be a multimodal intervention. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of a multimodal intervention (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid nutritional supplements, exercise, and anti-inflammatory medication: celecoxib) for cancer cachexia in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer, undergoing chemotherapy., METHODS: Patients receiving two cycles of standard chemotherapy were randomized to either the multimodal cachexia intervention or standard care. Primary outcome measures were feasibility assessed by recruitment, attrition, and compliance with intervention (>50% of components in >50% of patients). Key secondary outcomes were change in weight, muscle mass, physical activity, safety, and survival., RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-nine were screened resulting in 46 patients recruited (11.5%). Twenty five patients were randomized to the treatment and 21 as controls. Forty-one completed the study (attrition rate 11%). Compliance to the individual components of the intervention was 76% for celecoxib, 60% for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. As expected from the sample size, there was no statistically significant effect on physical activity or muscle mass. There were no intervention-related Serious Adverse Events and survival was similar between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal cachexia intervention is feasible and safe in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer; however, compliance to nutritional supplements was suboptimal. A phase III study is now underway to assess fully the effect of the intervention. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Our understanding of transmission at the neuromuscular junction has increased greatly in recent years. We now recognise a wide variety of autoimmune and genetic diseases that affect this specialised synapse, causing muscle weakness and fatigue. These disorders greatly affect quality of life and rarely can be fatal. Myasthenia gravis is the most common disorder and is most commonly caused by autoantibodies targeting postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. Antibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) are detected in a variable proportion of the remainder. Treatment is symptomatic and immunomodulatory. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is caused by antibodies to presynaptic calcium channels, and approximately 50% of cases are paraneoplastic, most often related to small cell carcinoma of the lung. Botulism is an acquired disorder caused by neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum, impairing acetylcholine release into the synaptic cleft. In addition, several rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have been identified, caused by inherited defects in presynaptic, synaptic basal lamina and postsynaptic proteins necessary for neuromuscular transmission. This review focuses on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

AB  - Muscle loss and wasting occurs with aging and in multiple disease states including cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage liver disease, end-stage renal disease and HIV. Cachexia is defined as a multifactorial syndrome that is associated with anorexia, weight loss and increased catabolism, with increased morbidity and mortality. Currently no therapy is approved for the treatment or prevention of cachexia. Different treatment options have been suggested but many have proven to be ineffective or associated with adverse events. Nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a new class of anabolic agents that bind the androgen receptor and exhibit tissue selectivity. Enobosarm (GTx-024, S-22) is a recently developed SARM, developed by GTx, Inc. (TN, USA), which has been tested in Phase I, II and III trials with promising results in terms of improving lean body mass and measurements of physical function and power. Enobosarm has received fast track designation by the US FDA and results from the Phase III trials POWER1 and POWER2 will help determine approval for use in the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. This article provides an introduction to enobosarm as a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of cachexia. A review of the literature was performed using search terms 'cachexia', 'sarcopenia', 'SARM', 'enobosarm' and 'GTx-024' in September 2013 using multiple databases as well as online resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle mass and physical function (PF) are common co-primary endpoints in cancer cachexia trials, but there is a lack of data on how these outcomes interact over time. The aim of this secondary analysis of data from a trial investigating multimodal intervention for cancer cachexia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01419145) is to explore whether changes in muscle mass and PF are associated with weight loss and cachexia status at baseline., METHODS: Secondary analysis was conducted using data from a phase II randomized controlled trial including 46 patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer (n = 26) or inoperable pancreatic cancer (n = 20) due to commence chemotherapy. Cachexia status at baseline was classified according to international consensus. Muscle mass (assessed using computed tomography (CT)) and PF outcomes, i.e., Karnofsky performance status (KPS), self-reported PF (self-PF), handgrip strength (HGS), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and physical activity (PA), were measured at baseline and after six weeks., RESULTS: When compared according to cachexia status at baseline, patients with no/pre-cachexia had a mean loss of muscle mass (-5.3 cm2, p = 0.020) but no statistically significant change in PF outcomes. Patients with cachexia also lost muscle mass but to a lesser extent (-2.8 cm2, p = 0.146), but demonstrated a statistically significant decline in PF; KPS (-3.8 points, p = 0.030), self-PF (-8.8 points, p = 0.027), and HGS (-2.7 kg, p = 0.026)., CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss history and cachexia status at baseline are of importance if one aims to detect changes in PF outcomes in cancer cachexia trials. To improve the use of co-primary endpoints that include PF in future trials, outcomes that have the potential to detect change relative to weight loss should be investigated further.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We compared the frequency of cancer, heart and lung related cachexia and cachexia-related research articles in the specialist journal, Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle (JCSM) to those seen in a leading European journal in each specialist area during 2015 and 2016 to assess whether work on cachexia and related fields is relatively over or under represented in each specialist area., RESULTS: In the dedicated journal, Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle, there were 44 references related to cancer, 5 related to respiratory disease, 5 related to heart failure, and 21 related to more than one of these chronic diseases. Despite this cancer preponderance, in the European Journal of Cancer in the two publication years, there were only 5 relevant publications (0.67% of the journal output), compared to 16 (1.41%) in the European Respiratory Journal and 10 (2.19%) in the European Journal of Heart Failure., CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable under-representation of cancer cachexia-related papers in the major European Cancer journal despite a high proportion in the dedicated cachexia journal. The under-representation is even more marked when expressed as a percentage, 0.67%, compared to 1.41% and 2.19% of the lung and heart journals respectively. These results are consistent with a worrying lack of interest in, or publication of, cachexia and related syndromes research in the cancer literature in Europe compared to its importance as a clinical syndrome. Greater interest is shown in lung and cardiology journals. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paraneoplastic hypercorticism appears either as a fullfledged Cushing's syndrome with adiposity of the trunk, moon face and striae or as a biochemical form with hypokalemic alkalosis, adynamia and muscular atrophy. A form of the disease with the biochemical type in bronichial carcinoma is reported, which emphasizes also the significance of paraneoplastic syndromes for the early diagnosis of neoplasia.

AB  - A 63-year-old man complained of rapidly progressive respiratory failure, requiring a control respiration. He subsequently, presented with muscle weakness involving the neck and all the extremities, superimposed by painful paresthesia. He was proven to carry small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Neurophysiological examinations revealed the waxing phenomenon at 30 Hz repetitive motor nerve stimulation. Positive serum autoantibodies were detected to voltage-gated calcium channel and Hu proteins. He received diagnosis of combined Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and anti-Hu syndrome. The initial chemotherapy for SCC alleviated his respiratory and neurological symptoms. But he developed multiple cranial palsies and fatal respiratory distress two months later. There is only a few reports about LEMS complicated by respiratory failure as an initial presentation. Various clinical manifestations including respiratory failure at the onset could be best explained by the combination of LEMS and anti-Hu syndrome in this case.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depletion in skeletal muscle is closely associated with limited physical ability and high mortality. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of skeletal muscle depletion in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with pathological stages I-II lung cancer, who underwent curative resection between 2009 and 2013, was conducted. The truncal muscle index (TMI) (area/height2) at the first lumbar vertebral level was measured by preoperative axial computed tomography. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were compared between the lowest gender-specific quartile of the TMI and the other quartiles., RESULTS: A total of 314 subjects were included in the study. The cumulative 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were significantly shorter in patients with lower TMIs (69% vs 83.5%, P = 0.028; 64.8% vs 80.1%, P = 0.003, respectively). In multivariable models, the TMI was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.017, hazard ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.12-3.05), after adjusting for age, gender, preoperative serum albumin, carcinoembryonic antigen, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and pathological stage., CONCLUSIONS: A low preoperative TMI was associated with a poor postoperative outcome in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. This factor may be included in the preoperative assessment of patients, for whom surgical intervention is considered. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of sarcopenia on the outcome in patients following resection of non-small cell lung cancer is yet to be fully determined. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of a computed tomography-based pectoralis muscle assessment, which reflects sarcopenia, to predict the risk of postoperative outcomes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 347 consecutive patients undergoing curative-intent resection of non-small cell lung cancer from 2009 to 2013. The pectoralis muscle index (pectoralis muscle area/body mass index) was assessed at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra on chest axial images. The primary outcomes were compared between the lowest gender-specific quintile (sarcopenia) and the other quintiles according to the index. The prognostic significance of low pectoralis muscle index was calculated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. A propensity score matching analysis was performed to adjust the differences in clinical characteristics., RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were identified with sarcopenia according to the lowest gender-specific quintile of pectoralis muscle index. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited worse 5-year overall survival rate compared with patients without sarcopenia (64.2% vs. 86.7%, P < 0.001). Even in stage I non-small cell lung cancer, the rate of 5-year overall survival in the sarcopenia group was lower than that in the non-sarcopenia group (74.2% vs. 92.4%, P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that low pectoralis muscle index was independently associated with adverse overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.20-3.62, P = 0.009). After propensity score matching, the prognostic impact of sarcopenia based on low pectoralis muscle index was also robust for overall survival (hazard ratio: 3.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-7.60, P = 0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: Low pectoralis muscle index was significantly associated with poor long-term outcomes in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer after curative surgery. This may help assist preoperative risk stratification and longitudinal management after surgery. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Muscle wasting is the hallmark of cancer cachexia and is associated with poor quality of life and increased mortality. Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has important biological effects in the treatment of muscular dystrophy. To verify whether VPA could ameliorate muscle wasting induced by cancer cachexia, we explored the role of VPA in two cancer cachectic mouse models [induced by colon-26 (C26) adenocarcinoma or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)] and atrophied C2C12 myotubes [induced by C26 cell conditioned medium (CCM) or LLC cell conditioned medium (LCM)]. Our data demonstrated that treatment with VPA increased the mass and cross-sectional area of skeletal muscles in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, treatment with VPA also increased the diameter of myotubes cultured in conditioned medium. The skeletal muscles in cachectic mice or atrophied myotubes treated with VPA exhibited reduced levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), resulting in atrogin1 downregulation and the eventual alleviation of muscle wasting and myotube atrophy. Moreover, atrogin1 promoter activity in myotubes was stimulated by CCM via activating the C/EBPbeta-responsive cis-element and subsequently inhibited by VPA. In contrast to the effect of VPA on the levels of C/EBPbeta, the levels of inactivating forkhead box O3 (FoxO3a) were unaffected. In summary, VPA attenuated muscle wasting and myotube atrophy and reduced C/EBPbeta binding to atrogin1 promoter locus in the myotubes. Our discoveries indicate that HDAC inhibition by VPA might be a promising new approach for the preservation of skeletal muscle in cancer cachexia.

AB  - Cancer-induced muscle wasting, which commonly occurs in cancer cachexia, is characterized by impaired quality of life and poor patient survival. To identify an appropriate treatment, research on the mechanism underlying muscle wasting is essential. Thus far, studies on muscle wasting using cancer cachectic models have generally focused on early cancer cachexia (ECC), before severe body weight loss occurs. In the present study, we established models of ECC and late cancer cachexia (LCC) and compared different stages of cancer cachexia using two cancer cachectic mouse models induced by colon-26 (C26) adenocarcinoma or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). In each model, tumor-bearing (TB) and control (CN) mice were injected with cancer cells and PBS, respectively. The TB and CN mice, which were euthanized on the 24th day or the 36th day after injection, were defined as the ECC and ECC-CN mice or the LCC and LCC-CN mice. In addition, the tissues were harvested and analyzed. We found that both the ECC and LCC mice developed cancer cachexia. The amounts of muscle loss differed between the ECC and LCC mice. Moreover, the expression of some molecules was altered in the muscles from the LCC mice but not in those from the ECC mice compared with their CN mice. In conclusion, the molecules with altered expression in the muscles from the ECC and LCC mice were not exactly the same. These findings may provide some clues for therapy which could prevent the muscle wasting in cancer cachexia from progression to the late stage.

AB  - This report describes a 63-yr-old man with lung cancer accompanying hypertension, hyperpigmentation, muscle weakness, psychosis, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, massive natriuresis and lower serum osmolality than urine osmolality. Elevated levels of plasma and urine corticosteroids and of plasma immunoreactive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were not altered by the administration of large amounts of dexamethasone. Elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) values were also demonstrated. Postmortem examinations revealed small cell lung carcinoma with extensive metastasis, bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and Crooke's degeneration of the pituitary gland. Immunoradiological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive ACTH, ADH and gastrin-releasing peptide in the tumor tissue. Beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen were also detected by one of the methods. Hence, this is a rare case of lung cancer with multiple hormone production and clinical and laboratory evidence of both the ectopic ACTH and ADH syndromes.

AB  - The specific characteristics of neuromuscular immune-related adverse events(irAEs)including myasthenia gravis have not been elucidated because the frequency is generally low, ranging from 1-2% of cancer patients undergoing therapy with programmed cell death 1(PD-1)inhibitors. Inflammatory myopathy(myositis)is also one of the representative neuromuscular irAEs. A variety of studies have demonstrated that myositis as an irAE is often accompanied by ocular muscle symptoms, which physicians have often termed "myasthenia-like" or "pseudo-myasthenic". We presented the clinical features of 19 Japanese patients with inflammatory myopathy associated with PD-1 inhibitors(PD-1 myopathy)(13 men and 6 women, mean age 70 years). Ten patients showed a mild form of disease and 9 patients showed a severe form. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common underlying cancer. PD-1 inhibitor consisted of 11 nivolumab and 8 pembrolizumab. PD-1 myopathy occurred 29 days on average after the first administration of PD-1 inhibitor. Serum creatine kinase(CK)was increased to 5,247 IU/L on average. Autoantibodies related to inflammatory myopathy were negative, while anti-striational antibodies were found in 13(68%). Muscle pathology was characterized by multifocal necrotic myofibers with endomysial inflammation. Immunotherapy with corticosteroids was generally effective for muscle weakness with prompt normalization of serum CK levels. Myasthenia gravis and myositis induced by PD-1 inhibitors may have the common clinical features and pathological mechanisms.

AB  - Change in body composition with skeletal muscle wasting, a major component of pulmonary cachexia, is associated with mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer. However, its relevance in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) remains unclear. We hypothesized changes in body composition would be associated with mortality in ILDs. We measured the cross-sectional-area (ESMCSA) and muscle attenuation (ESMMA) of erector-spinae muscles, as determined by CT-imaging, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 131) and idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (iPPFE; n = 43) and controls. Subsequently, implications with prognosis were evaluated. The ESMCSA of ILD patients, but not ESMMA, was significantly smaller than that in controls. Lower ESMCSA with decreased BMI were recorded in iPPFE patients versus IPF patients, whilst IPF patients had decreased ESMCSA without BMI decline. Lower ESMCSA in IPF patients were associated with poorer prognoses. Conversely, decreased ESMMA were associated with worse survival in iPPFE patients. Multivariate analyses showed that ESMCSA in IPF and ESMMA in iPPFE were independent risk factors for mortality. Distinct changes in body composition had prognostic significance among patients with IPF and iPPFE. Lower ESMCSA and ESMMA were independently associated with poor prognosis in IPF and iPPFE, respectively. These results suggest values to measure body composition changes in managing patients with IPF and iPPFE.

AB  - Patients with cancer have an increased risk of thromboembolism, which is the second leading cause of death in these patients. Several mechanisms of the prothrombotic state in these patients have been proposed. Among them are a platelet activation receptor, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), and its endogenous ligand podoplanin, which are the focus of this review. CLEC-2 is almost specifically expressed in platelets/megakaryocytes in humans. A membrane protein, podoplanin is expressed in certain types of cancer cells, including squamous cell carcinoma, brain tumor, and osteosarcoma, in addition to several normal tissues, including kidney podocytes and lymphatic endothelial cells but not vascular endothelial cells. In the bloodstream, podoplanin induces platelet activation by binding to CLEC-2 and facilitates hematogenous cancer metastasis and cancer-associated thrombosis. In an experimental lung metastasis model, the pharmacological depletion of CLEC-2 from platelets in mice resulted in a marked reduction of lung metastasis of podoplanin-expressing B16F10 cells. Control mice with B16F10 orthotopically inoculated in the back skin showed massive thrombus formation in the lungs, but the cancer-associated thrombus formation in CLEC-2-depleted mice was significantly inhibited, suggesting that CLEC-2-podoplanin interaction stimulates cancer-associated thrombosis. Thromboinflammation induced ectopic podoplanin expression in vascular endothelial cells or macrophages, which may also contribute to cancer-associated thrombosis. CLEC-2 depletion in cancer-bearing mice resulted in not only reduced cancer-associated thrombosis but also reduced levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines, anemia, and sarcopenia, suggesting that cancer-associated thrombosis may cause thromboinflammation and cancer cachexia. Blocking CLEC-2-podoplanin interaction may be a novel therapeutic strategy in patients with podoplanin-expressing cancer. Copyright © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from a previous phase 3 study suggested that prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolongs overall survival compared with no prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. However, because of the absence of brain imaging before enrolment and variations in chemotherapeutic regimens and irradiation doses, concerns have been raised about these findings. We did a phase 3 trial to reassess the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation in the treatment of extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer., METHODS: We did this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 47 institutions in Japan. Patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer who had any response to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and no brain metastases on MRI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy in ten daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or observation. All patients were required to have brain MRI at 3-month intervals up to 12 months and at 18 and 24 months after enrolment. Randomisation was done by computer-generated allocation sequence, with age as a stratification factor and minimisation by institution, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and response to initial chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000001755, and is closed to new participants., FINDINGS: Between April 3, 2009, and July 17, 2013, 224 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (113 to prophylactic cranial irradiation and 111 to observation). In the planned interim analysis on June 18, 2013, of the first 163 enrolled patients, Bayesian predictive probability of prophylactic cranial irradiation being superior to observation was 0.011%, resulting in early termination of the study because of futility. In the final analysis, median overall survival was 11.6 months (95% CI 9.5-13.3) in the prophylactic cranial irradiation group and 13.7 months (10.2-16.4) in the observation group (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% CI 0.96-1.68; p=0.094). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events at 3 months were anorexia (six [6%] of 106 in the prophylactic cranial irradiation group vs two [2%] of 111 in the observation group), malaise (three [3%] vs one [<1%]), and muscle weakness in a lower limb (one [<1%] vs six [5%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred in either group., INTERPRETATION: In this Japanese trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation did not result in longer overall survival compared with observation in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is therefore not essential for patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer with any response to initial chemotherapy and a confirmed absence of brain metastases when patients receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up., FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.

AB  - The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. It is associated with cancer, particularly small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), in 50-60% of LEMS patients; the nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Non-tumor LEMS has a strong association with HLA-DR3-B8. In approximately 15% of LEMS patients, no anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies are found, suggesting recognition of other targets(s). The VGCC-associated protein synaptotagmin could be one candidate, because it acts as an exocytotic calcium receptor, is implicated in fast ACh release; its N-terminus is exposed extracellularly during exocytosis and it is expressed in SCLC. Antibodies against synaptotagmin-1 were detected in both anti-VGCC-positive and -negative LEMS patients (20%), and it can be immunogenic, allowing induction of an animal model of LEMS. Another candidate target is the M1-type presynaptic muscarinic ACh receptor (M1 mAChR), also expressed extracellularly on motor nerve terminals; it modulates cholinergic transmission, linking to P/Q-type VGCC. In our series of 25 LEMS patients with and without SCLC, anti-M1 mAChR antibodies were prevalent in both anti-VGCC-positive and -negative LEMS patients. Autonomic symptoms seemed more frequent in the latter; serum from one of them passively transferred LEMS-type electrophysiological defects to mice. As a compensatory mechanism, researchers in Oxford suggested a shift in the dependence of ACh release from the P/Q-type to other types of VGCC. We have also focused on G protein-coupled mAChRs and neurotrophins, which may affect both P/Q-type VGCC and clathrin-independent "kiss-and-run" synaptic vesicle recycling (fast-mode of endocytosis) via protein kinase C activation. We hypothesize that these signaling cascades help to compensate for the immune-mediated defects in calcium entry in LEMS, compensation that may frequently be restricted by the coincident anti-M1 mAChR antibodies in this disease.

AB  - The neuromuscular junction has been recognized as a site for autoimmune and genetic disorders. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is mainly caused by postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) IgG1 antibodies that are directed against alpha-subunit 67-76 and 125-147 and activate complement. Thymic abnormalities are present in the autoimmune background. A proportion of MG patients without conformation-dependent AChR antibodies assayed by the cell-based method have muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies which are largely IgG4 and partially IgG1. MuSK is activated by Dok-7 and Lrp4 (agrin receptor) and contributes to AChR clustering at the postsynaptic membrane via various kinase cascades in collaboration with Wnt-MuSK/Frizzled-Dishevelled signaling. Rapsyn interacts with MuSK-linked chaperones to stabilize postsynaptic architecture and also contributes to AChR phosphorylation. MG-associated thymomas express antigens that trigger antibody responses which play a part in disease generation and modification. Among these, ryanodine receptor-1 (RyR1; acts on sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release) antibodies cause muscle contractile weakness. Transient receptor potential canonical-3 (TRPC3) antibodies are also detected in thymoma-associated MG patients; they may participate in muscle contractile weakness because TRPC3 acts on RyR1, and may also impair the refill of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ stores since TRPCs contribute to the receptor-operated Ca2+ influx via the phospholipase C (PLC)-diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway in cooperation with the store-operated, STIM1/Orai1-mediated Ca2+ influx and TRPCs-Homerl-IP3R interaction. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is caused by reduced ACh quantal release that occurs mainly because of presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) antibodies. Physicians should be vigilant for LEMS because it may predict an underlying malignancy, particularly small-cell lung carcinoma; SOX-1 antibodies are usually present in these patients and are absent in those who do not have caucer. Some patients with LEMS have antibodies against synaptotagmin-1, which associates with SNARE complex and functions as Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. The stimulation of the M1-type presynaptic muscarinic AChR (mAChR)(G-proterin-coupled receptor) can compensate for the deficiency of Ca2+-mediated ACh quantal release via the PLC/DAG-mediated mechanism; This acts in a manner similar to the BDNF/NT4-TrkB interaction. The detection of M1 mAChR antibodies in LEMS suggests an impaired compensatory mechanism and corresponds, at least in part, to autonomic symptoms. Congenital myasthenic syndromes are classified into presynaptic, synaptic basal lamina and postsynaptic defects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative skeletal muscle loss was reported to be associated with a postoperative poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the change in skeletal muscle mass after surgery and the postoperative outcomes in NSCLC patients., METHODS: The data were analyzed for 204 NSCLC patients who had undergone curative lung resection and whose preoperative and postoperative (1-year) computed tomographic images were available. The skeletal muscle area (SMA) at the 12th thoracic vertebra level was used. Postoperative/preoperative ratio was defined as postoperative normalized SMA (cm2/m2) divided by preoperative normalized SMA. The cutoff value was set to a postoperative/preoperative ratio of 0.9. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, the platelet-lymphocyte ratio, modified Glasgow prognostic score, and prognostic nutritional index were used to estimate change in the nutritional status., RESULTS: There were 70 patients (34.3%) classified into the SMA-decreased group. Low body mass index was significantly associated with the SMA-decreased patients (P = .019). The SMA-decreased status was an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival (P < .001) and disease-free survival (P = .001). The SMA-decreased status was significantly associated with the postoperative exacerbation of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (P = .009), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (P = .026), modified Glasgow prognostic score (P = .003), and prognostic nutritional index (P = .013)., CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle loss after surgery is significantly associated with poor postoperative outcomes in NSCLC patients. Further studies investigating the clinical impact of postoperative nutritional intervention are needed. Copyright © 2020 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A relationship between sarcopenia diagnosed by skeletal muscle area (SMA) and poor prognosis in cancer patients has recently been reported. This study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of postoperatively decreased SMA in patients with early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., METHODS: This study selected 101 patients with pathologic stage 1 NSCLC who had undergone pre- and postoperative (~ 1 year) computed tomography scans and lobectomy between 2005 and 2010 at Kyushu University Hospital. The post/pre ratio was defined as the postoperative normalized SMA (cm2/m2) at the 12th thoracic vertebra level divided by the preoperative normalized SMA. The cutoff value for the post/pre ratio was set at 0.9., RESULTS: The study classified 31 patients (30.7%) as having decreased SMA. Poor performance status (PS) was significantly associated with decreased SMA (p = 0.048). The patients with decreased SMA had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001) than the other patients. Decreased SMA was found to be an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.010) and OS (p = 0.0072). The independent risk factors for skeletal muscle loss included poor PS (PS >= 1) and obstructive ventilatory impairment [forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1% < 70%]., CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle loss after surgery is significantly associated with postoperative poor outcomes for patients with early NSCLC. Patients with poor PS, obstructive ventilatory impairment, or both need careful support to maintain their skeletal muscle mass. Future prospective studies may clarify whether physical activity and nutritional support improve postoperative prognosis.

AB  - A 77-year-old man with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accompanied by polyneuropathy and SIADH is reported. The patient first developed peripheral hyperesthesia and muscle weakness 6 months before admission. He was diagnosed as having SCLC by sputum cytology and supraclavicular lymph node biopsy. On admission, chest radiography and CT scan revealed a mediastinal mass, and the conduction velocity in peripheral nerves was delayed. He was also found to have SIADH, on the basis of an extremely low level of serum Na (114 mEq/l) and osmotic pressure (251 mOsm/kg) but with normal urinary Na and osmotic pressure. In association with complete disappearance of the mediastinal mass after intensive chemotherapy, SIADH and polyneuropathy also improved remarkably. When SCLC relapsed in the abdominal lymph nodes 11 months after complete disappearance of the mediastinal mass, polyneuropathy and SIADH also reappeared. These results indicate that both SIADH and polyneuropathy comprised a paraneoplastic syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cachexia is a progressive deterioration of body habitus associated with certain chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease). The aim of this article is to describe the prevalence and impact of cachexia (and precachexia) in such patients., RECENT FINDINGS: Owing to the wide spectrum of clinical presentation and lack of an 'all-inclusive' definition, it is difficult to estimate the true prevalence of cachexia. Perhaps 2% of the population suffer from precachexia (characterized by weight loss in association with a chronic disease). The significant increase in obesity of the general population (which can mask significant muscle wasting) confounds such simple estimates of the true prevalence of cachexia. In contrast, a multidimensional characterization of the cachectic state (including weight loss, reduced food intake, and systemic inflammation) may be more meaningful in terms of altered clinical outcomes. Such a multidimensional view of cachexia has been shown to impact on patients' survival and quality of life and therefore constitutes a major public health issue., SUMMARY: There is a high prevalence of (pre)cachexia in patients with chronic diseases. The cachexia syndrome is probably less frequent but has a significant impact in terms of morbidity and mortality.

AB  - The patient was a 57-year-old female who felt muscle weakness and visited a physician. Hypokalemia was pointed out, and she was referred to our hospital for detailed examination and treatment. Hormone-related tests and imaging were performed, and the patient was diagnosed as Cushing syndrome. Moreover, an ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumor was suspected. The whole body was examined to find a tumor, but no apparent lesion was found, except for a small nodule of 5-mm in size was present in the right middle pulmonary lobe on chest computed tomography (CT). It was decided to perform surgical resection for both diagnosis and treatment. Pathological diagnosis was a typical carcinoid. On immunostaining, ACTH-positive cells were detected, and the lesion was definitely diagnosed as an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. Since the ACTH level after surgery returned to normal, the lesion was concluded to be completely excised.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normally reliable neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This disruption is thought to result from an autoantibody-mediated removal of a subset of the P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels involved with neurotransmitter release. With less neurotransmitter release at the NMJ, LEMS patients experience debilitating muscle weakness. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung cancer, and cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. In the remaining cases, the cause of LEMS is unknown, and these patients often rely on symptomatic treatment options, as there is no cure. However, current symptomatic treatment options, such as 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), can have significant dose-limiting side effects; thus, additional treatment approaches would benefit LEMS patients. Recent studies introduced a novel Ca(2+) channel agonist (GV-58) as a potential therapeutic alternative for LEMS. Additionally, this work has shown that GV-58 and 3,4-DAP interact in a supra-additive manner to completely restore the magnitude of neurotransmitter release at the NMJs of a LEMS mouse model. In this review, we discuss synaptic mechanisms for reliability at the NMJ and how these mechanisms are disrupted in LEMS. We then discuss the current treatment options for LEMS patients, while also considering recent work demonstrating the therapeutic potential of GV-58 alone and in combination with 3,4-DAP.

AB  - After 30 years of age physical capacity decreases with increasing age by 5-20% per decade. High physical activity in daily life as well as exercise training of endurance, strength, coordination and mobility can delay the functional and anatomical loss of muscle, bone, cartilage and connective tissue by more than 10 years. In recent years, numerous concepts have scientifically been proven in the exercise therapy of internal diseases; therefore, similar to drug treatment, cellular mechanisms of exercise training adaptation are known in detail. With this knowledge the type, dose and intensity of exercise training can be defined in such a way that the targeted use of physical training can achieve health benefits similar to the effects achieved by drugs. This applies to the cardiovascular system, lungs, cancer, metabolic diseases and the immune system. In exercise training therapy of patients, individual exercise programs should be defined in a way that the contents of endurance, strength, coordination and mobility address all health and personal concerns of the patient. For sustained effects and high motivation, the individual and disease-specific definition of exercise programs as well as regular monitoring are necessary. The prescription for movement as well as the prescriptions for sports rehabilitation and functional training incorporate important assistance in this context.

AB  - There are roughly two types of ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS). one associated with overt malignancies and one with occult neoplasms. The prototype of the first condition is Cushing's syndrome sustained by small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), while bronchial carcinoid tumors are the most common occult sources of ACTH. Patients with EAS and SCLC may have an atypical presentation with muscle wasting and weight loss that are more frequently observed than the classic cushingoid features. These patients have a poor prognosis because SCLC associated with the EAS is more resistant to chemotherapy and the severe hypercortisolism is responsible for a high rate of life-threatening complications during treatment. Conversely, the clinical and biochemical features of the EAS associated with carcinoid may overlap those seen in pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. An extensive radiological and hormonal work-up is necessary to detect the extrapituitary source of ACTH. However, the differentiation between the pituitary, or eutopic, from the non-pituitary, or ectopic, source of ACTH secretion may be extremely difficult in some cases despite the wide diagnostic armamentarium available. Molecular biology studies have demonstrated that the carcinoid cells achieve a process of corticotroph differentiation being able to express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and to process POMC correctly to release large amounts of intact ACTH. Conversely, SCLC processes POMC in an aberrant way releasing high concentrations of ACTH precursors and less intact ACTH in the circulation.

AB  - Patients with pancreatic cancer show evidence of cachexia at the time of diagnosis, involving not only loss of adipose tissue, but also lean body mass. The shorter survival time of men than women with non-small cell lung cancer has been attributed to their enhanced rate of weight loss. From studies in animal models, various cytokines have been proposed as mediators of the cachectic process, although evidence from human studies is generally lacking. Only serum levels of IL-6 have been found to correlate with the clinical development of cachexia, but this may be a marker for the process rather than the actual mediator, because the direct administration of this cytokine to experimental animals failed to induce cachexia, despite the induction of an acute-phase response. Ciliary neurotrophic factor, a member of the IL-6 superfamily, has, however, been shown to produce loss of muscle mass in experimental animals, although it failed to exert a direct catabolic effect on muscle in vitro. A sulphated glycoprotein found in the urine of patients with cancer cachexia is capable of directly inducing protein catabolism in skeletal muscle by a process involving an increase in prostaglandin E2. Agents capable of attenuating this effect, e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid and ibuprofen, have been shown to stabilize body weight loss in cachectic cancer patients. This pharmacological approach to the treatment of cachexia appears to be more successful than nutritional manipulation.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease that has served as a model for autoimmunity and tumour immunology. In LEMS, the characteristic muscle weakness is thought to be caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) present on the presynaptic nerve terminal. Half of patients with LEMS have an associated tumour, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which also expresses functional VGCC. Knowledge of this association led to the discovery of a wide range of paraneoplastic and non-tumour-related neurological disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Detailed clinical studies have improved our diagnostic skills and knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms and association of LEMS with SCLC, and have helped with the development of a protocol for early tumour detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of skeletal muscle mass is the corner stone of cancer cachexia, but no effective therapies are yet identified. The optimal protein quantity and pattern to support muscle mass maintenance in cancer patients is unknown. The aim of the current exploratory study was to observe the pattern and quantity of dietary protein intake as well as the prevalence of muscle wasting in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing primary anti-neoplastic treatment. The secondary aim was to assess the potential contributory factors associated with maintenance of muscle mass., METHOD: A longitudinal observational study was conducted in patients with NSCLC undergoing first line of anti-neoplastic treatment. Nutrient intake was assessed by repeated 24-h recalls and skeletal muscle by routine thoraco-abdominal CT scans at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. Descriptive analyses, paired samples t-test, binomial logistic and linear regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Out of 186 consecutively screened patients, 62 were included and 52 patients were available for analysis. Protein intake increased from baseline to follow up, but were lower in muscle wasters (1.0 g/kg/d) than in muscle maintainers (1.4 g/kg/d). The majority of the meals contributed less than 20 g of protein and less than 10% of the meals contributed at least 40 g of protein. Significant loss of skeletal muscle area was observed in 26 out of 52 patients. A higher protein intake (OR 18.7, p = 0.01), energy intake (OR 1.1, p = 0.04) and stable body weight (OR 1.2, p = 0.03) were associated with muscle maintenance in the univariate regression, whereas age, sex, cachexia, tumour stage, treatment adherence and response did not. In the multivariate regression, a trend was seen for protein intake (OR 35.2, p = 0.08) and body weight (OR 1.2, p = 0.06)., CONCLUSION: Muscle wasting occurred frequently and early during primary anti-neoplastic treatment. Protein intake seems important for maintaining skeletal muscle. Validated dietary methods in cancer patients must be identified and the optimal protein quantity and intake pattern to support muscle maintenance should be explored in future trials.

AB  - Formoterol is a highly potent beta2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, which is a muscle growth promoter in many animal species. Myostatin/activin inhibition reverses skeletal muscle loss and prolongs survival of tumor-bearing animals. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of a combination of the soluble myostatin receptor ActRIIB (sActRIIB) and the beta2-agonist formoterol in the cachectic Lewis lung carcinoma model. The combination of formoterol and sActRIIB was extremely effective in reversing muscle wasting associated with experimental cancer cachexia in mice. Muscle weights from tumor-bearing animals were completely recovered following treatment and this was also reflected in the measured grip strength. This combination increased food intake in both control and tumor-bearing animals. The double treatment also prolonged survival significantly without affecting the weight and growth of the primary tumor. In addition, it significantly reduced the number of metastasis. Concerning the mechanisms for the preservation of muscle mass during cachexia, the effects of formoterol and sActRIIB seemed to be additive, since formoterol reduced the rate of protein degradation (as measured in vitro as tyrosine release, using incubated isolated individual muscles) while sActRIIB only affected protein synthesis (as measured in vivo using tritiated phenylalanine). Formoterol also increased the rate of protein synthesis and this seemed to be favored by the presence of sActRIIB. Combining formoterol and sActRIIB seemed to be a very promising treatment for experimental cancer cachexia. Further studies in human patients are necessary and may lead to a highly effective treatment option for muscle wasting associated with cancer. Copyright © 2015 UICC.

AB  - The presence of a tumour is very often associated with wasting in the host, affecting both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In the present study we used sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with anti-tumour activity, in order to investigate the effects of chemotherapy on wasting. Three different experimental mouse tumour models were included: C26 colon carcinoma, B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). The results obtained clearly show that sorafenib was effective in reducing tumour growth in LLC and B16 models, while it had no effect on C26. Interestingly, sorafenib treatment reduced the signs of muscle wasting and improved the physical activity in the LLC model and also in the C26, despite the absence of antineoplastic action in the latter. Our results discard a role for IL-6 in the action of sorafenib since the drug did not affect the levels of this cytokine. Conversely, sorafenib seems to act by influencing both STAT3 and ERK activity at muscle level, leading to reduced accumulation of Pax7 and atrogin-1. Sorafenib may interfere with muscle wasting by decreasing the activation of these signal transduction pathways.

AB  - Cachexia is a metabolic wasting disorder characterized by progressive weight loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, weakness, and appetite loss. Cachexia is associated with almost all major chronic illnesses including cancer, heart failure, obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney disease and significantly impedes treatment outcome and therapy tolerance, reducing physical function and increasing mortality. Current cachexia treatments are limited and new pharmacological strategies are needed. Agonists for the growth hormone secretagogue (GHS-R1a), or ghrelin receptor, prospectively regulate the central regulation of appetite and growth hormone secretion, and therefore have tremendous potential as cachexia therapeutics. Non-peptide GHS-R1a agonists are of particular interest, especially given the high gastrointestinal degradation of peptide-based structures, including that of the endogenous ligand, ghrelin, which has a half-life of only 30 min. However, few compounds have been reported in the literature as non-peptide GHS-R1a agonists. In this paper, we investigate the in vitro potential of quinolone compounds to modulate the GHS-R1a in both transfected human cells and mouse hypothalamic cells. These chemically synthesized compounds demonstrate a promising potential as GHS-R1a agonists, shown by an increased intracellular calcium influx. Further studies are now warranted to substantiate and exploit the potential of these novel quinolone-based compounds as orexigenic therapeutics in conditions of cachexia and other metabolic and eating disorders.

AB  - Weight loss and depletion of nutritional status are frequent presentation hallmarks in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Decline in muscle mass is a major component in weight loss and may have both a prognostic and predictive value for survival and treatment-related toxicities. Recent findings suggest that weight and skeletal muscle mass gain during treatment may represent surrogate markers for outcome in advanced NSCLC patients. Herein we present an in-depth view of the impact of nutritional status derangements on NSCLC patients' outcome, focusing on lean body mass variations during disease course. We explored the impact of malnutrition with a major attention on novel treatment options. We reviewed molecular, metabolic and immunological mechanisms underlying muscle-wasting condition, which may exhibit a meaningful targeting potential. Incorporating a specialized and accurate body composition assessment into a comprehensive, patient-centered and tailored intervention will facilitate the achievement of nutritional goals and optimal care for lung cancer patients.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. It is characterized by muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic dysfunction. It is most often associated with small cell carcinomas of the lung. Rare cases have been reported in children. We recently encountered two children with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome associated with antibodies to P/Q-type calcium channel but without evidence of neoplasms. Both patients showed prolonged and significant improvement following cyclosporin treatment. The diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome should be considered in children with progressive weakness and a negative work-up for the usual causes. High-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation and P/Q-type calcium-channel antibodies may confirm the diagnosis.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial, critical illness syndrome characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The reductions in body weight and skeletal muscle mass are important prognostic indicators for cancer patients that are refractory to current therapies. Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is produced in the stomach, stimulates food intake and growth hormone secretion, suppresses inflammation, and prevents muscle catabolism. We investigated the pharmacological potential of ghrelin in the treatment of cancer cachexia by using urethane-treated, bronchioalveolar epithelium-specific Pten-deficient mice that developed lung adenocarcinomas. Ghrelin or phosphate-buffered saline was given to mice daily for four weeks beginning at five months after urethane injection, which corresponded to the time point of lung adenocarcinoma formation. Ghrelin inhibited the inductions of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6, mitigated the reduction of food intake and fat mass, and consequently ameliorated body weight loss in the mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. We also demonstrated that skeletal muscle mass and muscle contraction force in both fast-twitch muscle and slow-twitch muscle were retained in ghrelin-treated mice in conjunction with an upregulation of local insulin-like growth factor 1/Akt signaling. In addition, ghrelin administration reduced the expressions of phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphorylated-nuclear factor-kappa B, Forkhead box protein O1, muscle RING-finger protein-1, and F-Box protein 32 in the lysates of skeletal muscle in the tumor-bearing state. Our results indicate that ghrelin administration exerts a protective effect against cancer cachexia by ameliorating skeletal muscle wasting and regulating systemic inflammation.

AB  - Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death-1, significantly prolongs survival for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the value of predictive biomarkers. Hence, we investigated the impact of skeletal muscle (SM) mass loss on clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients undergoing nivolumab treatment. Thirty patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC treated with nivolumab were included in this study. Computed tomography was used to determine SM loss based on the SM index (SMI). The SMI is the cross-sectional area of the bilateral psoas muscles at the third lumbar vertebra, divided by height squared. The cut-off values were defined as 6.36 cm/m for men and 3.92 cm/m for women. Among the 30 patients, 13 (43%) had SM loss. There was no significant association between SM loss and immune-related adverse events. The SM loss group had undergone significantly more prior chemotherapy cycles (P = .04). SM loss was significantly associated with fewer nivolumab cycles (P = .01). No patients in the SM loss group achieved a partial response. Patients with SM loss had a significantly shorter progression-free survival period (P = .008) and median overall survival than those with normal SM mass (10 vs 25 months, respectively, P = .03). SM loss was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival. In conclusion, SM loss may be a predictive factor of poor outcomes in NSCLS patients undergoing nivolumab therapy.

AB  - We encountered a very rare case of cT0N2M0 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). A 69-year-old man with a complaint of muscle weakness was admitted to our hospital. Although his chest radiograph on admission showed no abnormal findings, CT scanning detected a mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Also, 2-[18F]-2-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose position emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed increased accumulation in the same portion in the mediastinum. A diagnosis of LEMS was made from the distinctive electromyogram (EMG) findings (waning and waxing phenomenon in response to low-and high-frequency repetitive stimulation, respectively) in combination with the increased serum level of a P/Q-type anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody. Subsequent histopathological diagnosis by mediastinoscopic resection of a paraaortic lymph node was small cell carcinoma. No distant metastasis was detected by MRI of the brain, abdominal CT scan or an FDG-PET. Eight courses of chemotherapy (carboplatin + etoposide) with radiotherapy of the mediastinum (for a total dose of 45 Gy) was performed. A decreased serum level of P/Q-type anti-VGCC antibody titers followed by marked improvement of neurological dysfunction (muscle weakness, gait disturbance and scanning speech) and of an EMG finding (a loss of waning phenomenon) was observed. A close relationship between reduction of the antibody titers and improvement of neurological symptoms after the therapy was noticed. It was suggested that monitoring the level of a P/Q-type anti-VGCC antibody titer in the serum is important for evaluating the efficacy of chemotherapy for LEMS associated with SCLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We often experienced early recurrence in patients with completely resected N2-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of muscle mass is a poor prognostic factor in patients with several stages of NSCLC. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between preoperative loss of muscle mass and postoperative early recurrence in patients with N2-positive NSCLC., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 47 male patients with completely resected pathological N2-positive NSCLC. Early recurrence was defined as that diagnosed within 1 year after the operation. We used the L3 muscle index (cross-sectional area of muscle at the L3 level, normalized for height) as a clinical measurement of loss of muscle mass (cutoff value, 52.4 cm2/m2)., RESULTS: In all, 18 patients with early recurrence had significantly poorer outcomes compared with those without (P <0.01). In univariate analysis, loss of muscle mass (P = 0.023), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level >5.0 ng/mL (P = 0.002), and absence of postoperative chemotherapy (P = 0.042) were predictors of postoperative early recurrence. In multivariate analysis, loss of muscle mass (P = 0.004) and CEA level >5.0 ng/mL (P = 0.001) were independent predictors., CONCLUSIONS: Loss of muscle mass is an independent predictor of postoperative early recurrence in pathological N2-positive NSCLC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical indication in stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer is still controversial. Hence, there is a need for the identification of predictors of the postoperative outcome in these patients. Although sarcopenia is expected to be a novel predictor of postoperative outcome in these patients, the underlying clinical features of sarcopenia have not been well investigated. Elevation of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio indicates cancer-associated inflammation and depression of anticancer immunity. We analyzed the influence of sarcopenia on postoperative prognosis, and investigated the relationship between sarcopenia and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer., METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 69 patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer. We used the L3 muscle index as a clinical measurement of sarcopenia, and divided patients into the sarcopenic (n = 21) and the non-sarcopenic group (n = 48). We then investigated the effect of sarcopenia on postoperative prognosis, and evaluated the correlation between sarcopenia and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio., RESULTS: This study included 47 males and 22 females. Univariate analysis revealed that sarcopenia, performance status, and serum cytokeratin-19 fragment level were predictors of poor prognosis; multivariate analysis revealed that performance status and sarcopenia were independent predictors of poor prognosis. The presence of sarcopenia was significantly correlated with neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio elevation., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a novel predictor of poor prognosis in patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio elevation might be the reason for poor prognosis in sarcopenic patients.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder typically associated with small cell lung carcinoma. The characterstic electrophysiological abnormality is a low amplitude compound muscle action potential that shows a marked increment after maximal voluntary contraction or brief tetanic nerve stimulation. We describe a patient who had LEMS in association with Hodgkin's disease. A 61 year old woman presented with proximal muscle weakness 6 years following successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease. Her symptoms responded well to treatment with diaminopyridine. 9 additional patients have been described with LEMS in association with lymphoproliferative diseases. A systemic malignancy is usually found within 2 years of LEMS diagnosis but may present later. LEMS should be considered in patients with Hodgkin's disease presenting with muscle weakness.

AB  - Approximately half of all cancer patients present with cachexia, a condition in which disease-associated metabolic changes lead to a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass. Working toward an integrated and mechanistic view of cancer cachexia, we investigated the hypothesis that cancer promotes mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle. We subjected mice to in vivo phosphorous-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy and subjected murine skeletal muscle samples to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The mice used in both experiments were Lewis lung carcinoma models of cancer cachexia. A novel 'fragmented mass isotopomer' approach was used in our dynamic analysis of 13C mass isotopomer data. Our 31P NMR and GC/MS results indicated that the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rate and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux were reduced by 49% and 22%, respectively, in the cancer-bearing mice (p<0.008; t-test vs. controls). The ratio of ATP synthesis rate to the TCA cycle flux (an index of mitochondrial coupling) was reduced by 32% in the cancer-bearing mice (p=0.036; t-test vs. controls). Genomic analysis revealed aberrant expression levels for key regulatory genes and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the muscle fiber, consistent with the presence of abnormal, giant mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest that mitochondrial uncoupling occurs in cancer cachexia and thus point to the mitochondria as a potential pharmaceutical target for the treatment of cachexia. These findings may prove relevant to elucidating the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle wasting observed in other chronic diseases, as well as in aging.

AB  - A 77-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with muscle weakness and shortness of breath. Chest CT showed a mass in the left upper lobe, and electromyography showed waxing phenomenon with high-frequency repetitive stimulation. We diagnosed Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome accompanying small cell lung cancer. He was treated with carboplatin and etoposide, and concurrent thoracic irradiation. Although, the tumor size decreased, his myasthenic symptoms remained. He started taking 3,4-diaminopyridine and his muscle weakness improved dramatically, and he was eventually able to walk finally. In some cases, anti-tumor therapies cannot improve the myasthenic symptoms. In such cases, 3,4-diaminopyridine could improve the quality of life, and should be approved in Japan.

AB  - A 65-year-old male was admitted with the chief complaint of voiding difficulty on 28 October, 2001. He was in the state of urinary retention. Urological investigation including cystosocopy, urethrocystography, and urodynamic study revealed an areflex-type bladder, according to the new International Continence Society (ICS) classification with no prostatic urethral obstruction. He was diagnosed with neurogenic bladder although the cause of detrusor areflex was unknown. Because all medication was ineffective, transurethral resection of prostate was performed on 11 January, 2002, but urinary retention could not be relieved. After operation, he complained of muscle weakness of upper extremities and poor control of bowels. He was diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome associated with small cell lung carcinoma. His myasthenic symptoms, including autonomic symptoms were relieved after chemotherapy and radiation for small cell lung carcinoma.

AB  - Among the diseases frequently associated with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) count the pulmonary neoplasm, severe cardiovascular diseases, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus etc. These conditions are often diagnosed when already in an advanced stage, although their presence may seriously affect the patient's quality of life and prognostic. Under certain circumstances the early usage of imagistic techniques in addition to the pulmonary functional tests leads not only to the early adopting of an adequate treatment that considers the comorbidity, but offers also a better understanding of the COPD's physiopathology, of its--and of the associated diseases' evolution.

AB  - Sarcopenia is the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging. Our research group has found an efficacious administration paradigm using testosterone to combat sarcopenia in humans. In addition, our research has uncovered an important regulatory enzyme of inflammation, nuclear factor-kappaB-inducing kinase that may regulate human skeletal muscle catabolism, and that appears to be counter-regulated by administration of standard doses of testosterone. This is important because a number of age-related clinical circumstances trigger acute and chronic muscle loss including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hospitalization, acute and chronic illness, and diseases in which systemic inflammation occurs. Moreover, it is often the treatment itself that can induce muscle loss. For example, glucocorticoids are tremendously effective at reducing inflammation and are a frontline therapy for many inflammatory-based diseases, yet paradoxically trigger muscle loss. We will discuss our research findings and the clinical significance of our human clinical translational research with testosterone.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis and unspecified myositis are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in which prednisone is usually started as soon as the diagnosis has been established. Therefore, little is known about the natural history of these diseases and spontaneous recovery may escape attention. Here, we present three patients who achieved remission without administration of immunosuppressants. In these three patients, treatment was not started because of spontaneously improving symptoms and signs during the diagnostic process. After 3-5 years, all patients are still free of muscle weakness. These case reports demonstrate that spontaneous long lasting remission can occur in a small proportion of patients with subacute onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. In some patients, immunosuppressive treatment with the risk of serious side effects can perhaps be omitted. However, close and frequent monitoring is required in these instances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cachexia, highly prevalent in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), impairs quality of life and is associated with reduced tolerance and responsiveness to cancer therapy and decreased survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a central role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Changes in intramuscular levels of miRNAs have been implicated in muscle wasting conditions. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in skeletal muscle of cachectic lung cancer patients to increase our understanding of cachexia and to allow us to probe their potential as therapeutic targets., METHODS: A total of 754 unique miRNAs were profiled and analysed in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of newly diagnosed treatment-naive NSCLC patients with cachexia (n = 8) and age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 8). miRNA expression analysis was performed using a TaqMan MicroRNA Array. In silico network analysis was performed on all significant differentially expressed miRNAs. Differential expression of the top-ranked miRNAs was confirmed using reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR in an extended group (n = 48) consisting of NSCLC patients with (n = 15) and without cachexia (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 22). Finally, these miRNAs were subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis using overall survival and treatment-induced toxicity data obtained during the follow-up of this group of patients., RESULTS: We identified 28 significant differentially expressed miRNAs, of which five miRNAs were up-regulated and 23 were down-regulated. In silico miRNA-target prediction analysis showed 158 functional gene targets, and pathway analysis identified 22 pathways related to the degenerative or regenerative processes of muscle tissue. Subsequently, the expression of six top-ranked miRNAs was measured in muscle biopsies of the entire patient group. Five miRNAs were detectable with reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR analysis, and their altered expression (expressed as fold change, FC) was confirmed in muscle of cachectic NSCLC patients compared with healthy control subjects: miR-424-5p (FC = 4.5), miR-424-3p (FC = 12), miR-450a-5p (FC = 8.6), miR-144-5p (FC = 0.59), and miR-451a (FC = 0.57). In non-cachectic NSCLC patients, only miR-424-3p was significantly increased (FC = 5.6) compared with control. Although the statistical support was not sufficient to imply these miRNAs as individual predictors of overall survival or treatment-induced toxicity, when combined in multivariate analysis, miR-450-5p and miR-451a resulted in a significant stratification between short-term and long-term survival., CONCLUSIONS: We identified differentially expressed miRNAs putatively involved in lung cancer cachexia. These findings call for further studies to investigate the causality of these miRNAs in muscle atrophy and the mechanisms underlying their differential expression in lung cancer cachexia.

AB  - The loss of skeletal muscle mass is recognized as a complication of several chronic diseases and is associated with increased mortality and a decreased quality of life. Relevant and reliable animal models in which muscle wasting can be monitored noninvasively over time are instrumental to investigate and develop new therapies. In this work, we developed a fully automatic deep learning algorithm for segmentation of micro cone beam computed tomography images of the lower limb muscle complex in mice and subsequent muscle mass calculation. A deep learning algorithm was trained on manually segmented data from 32 mice. Muscle wet mass measurements were obtained from 47 mice and served as a data set for model validation and reverse model validation. The automatic algorithm performance was ~150 times faster than manual segmentation. Reverse validation of the algorithm showed high quantitative metrics (i.e., a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.93, a Hausdorff distance of 0.4 mm, and a center of mass displacement of 0.1 mm), substantiating the robustness and accuracy of the model. A high correlation (R2 = 0.92) was obtained between the computed tomography-derived muscle mass measurements and the muscle wet masses. Longitudinal follow-up revealed time-dependent changes in muscle mass that separated control from lung tumor-bearing mice, which was confirmed as cachexia. In conclusion, this deep learning model for automated assessment of the lower limb muscle complex provides highly accurate noninvasive longitudinal evaluation of skeletal muscle mass. Furthermore, it facilitates the workflow and increases the amount of data derived from mouse studies while reducing the animal numbers. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This deep learning application enables highly accurate noninvasive longitudinal evaluation of skeletal muscle mass changes in mice with minimal requirement for operator involvement in the data analysis. It provides a unique opportunity to increase and analyze the amount of data derived from animal studies automatically while reducing animal numbers and analytical workload.

AB  - Long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) experience several late adverse effects of treatment, with second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being the leading causes of death in these patients. Other late effects have also been identified, such as pulmonary dysfunction, endocrinopathies (thyroid dysfunction, infertility), neck muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue. HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies. The relative risk (RR) of solid tumors increases steadily with increasing follow-up time from 5 to 15 years since radiotherapy, and remains elevated for at least 40 years. The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular toxicity following radiotherapy is usually observed from 5 to at least 35 years after therapy, whereas anthracycline-related toxicity is already observed during treatment, up to at least 25 years. The joint effects of anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity) appear to be additive rather than multiplicative. HL survivors need lifelong risk-based screening for selected SMNs and CVDs. Furthermore, preventive strategies should include lifestyle and drug-based interventions to minimize exposure to conventional risk factors for cancer and CVD.

AB  - Muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of a number of conditions, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and other chronic diseases, where it is generally a predictor of poor survival. It also occurs as a consequence of disuse and an age-related loss of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). The aims of the 2016, International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research (ICFSR) Task Force were to examine how these specific chronic conditions have been employed in treatment trials thus far and how future trials using these patient groups might be designed for efficient identification of effective sarcopenia interventions. Functional limitations assessed as gait speed, distance walked over a set time period, or other attributes of physical performance have been suggested as outcome measures in sarcopenia trials. Indeed, such measures have already been used successfully in a number of trials aimed at preventing disability in older adults.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a rare, but reasonably well-understood, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease that is caused by serum auto-antibodies and results in muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. One half of the patients have an idiopathic form, the other half a tumour-associated form of the disease. Three randomised trials and a large number of smaller clinical studies have resulted in a number of drugs becoming available for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Several drugs are available for the symptomatic treatment of the disease, including guanidine, aminopyridines or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Other therapies aim to deplete the serum autoantibodies or to suppress the immune system. For this purpose, immunomodulating strategies, such as intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, or several immunosuppressive agents are available. Chemotherapy has successfully ameliorated the course of disease in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome patients with an underlying tumour.

AB  - The global prevalence of physiologically defined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults aged >40 yr is approximately 9-10 per cent. Recently, the Indian Study on Epidemiology of Asthma, Respiratory Symptoms and Chronic Bronchitis in Adults had shown that the overall prevalence of chronic bronchitis in adults >35 yr is 3.49 per cent. The development of COPD is multifactorial and the risk factors of COPD include genetic and environmental factors. Pathological changes in COPD are observed in central airways, small airways and alveolar space. The proposed pathogenesis of COPD includes proteinase-antiproteinase hypothesis, immunological mechanisms, oxidant-antioxidant balance, systemic inflammation, apoptosis and ineffective repair. Airflow limitation in COPD is defined as a postbronchodilator FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec) to FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio <0.70. COPD is characterized by an accelerated decline in FEV1. Co morbidities associated with COPD are cardiovascular disorders (coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure), hypertension, metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and obesity), bone disease (osteoporosis and osteopenia), stroke, lung cancer, cachexia, skeletal muscle weakness, anaemia, depression and cognitive decline. The assessment of COPD is required to determine the severity of the disease, its impact on the health status and the risk of future events (e.g., exacerbations, hospital admissions or death) and this is essential to guide therapy. COPD is treated with inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, oral theophylline and oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. Non pharmacological treatment of COPD includes smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation and nutritional support. Lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation are advised in selected severe patients. Global strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease guidelines recommend influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inhalation of cigarette smoke causes inflammation of the airways, airway wall remodelling, mucus hypersecretion and progressive airflow limitation. Much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities and infectious (viral and bacterial) exacerbations (AECOPD). Comorbidities, in particular skeletal muscle wasting, cardiovascular disease and lung cancer markedly impact on disease morbidity, progression and mortality. The mechanisms and mediators underlying COPD and its comorbidities are poorly understood and current COPD therapy is relatively ineffective. Many researchers have used animal modelling systems to explore the mechanisms underlying COPD, AECOPD and comorbidities of COPD with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets. Here we describe a mouse model that we have developed to define the cellular, molecular and pathological consequences of cigarette smoke exposure and the development of comorbidities of COPD.

AB  - Muscular strength, an important component of physical fitness, has an independent role in the prevention of chronic diseases whereas muscular weakness is strongly related to functional limitations and physical disability. Our purpose was to investigate the role of muscular strength as a predictor of mortality in health and disease. We conducted a systematic search in EMBASE and MEDLINE (1980-2014) looking for the association between muscular strength and mortality risk (all-cause and cause-specific mortality). Selected publications included 23 papers (15 epidemiological and 8 clinical studies). Muscular strength was inversely and independently associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for several confounders including the levels of physical activity or even cardiorespiratory fitness. The same pattern was observed for cardiovascular mortality; however more research is needed due to the few available data. The existed studies failed to show that low muscular strength is predictive of cancer mortality. Furthermore, a strong and inverse association of muscular strength with all-cause mortality has also been confirmed in several clinical populations such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cancer, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis and patients with critical illness. However, future studies are needed to further establish the current evidence and to explore the exact independent mechanisms of muscular strength in relation to mortality. Muscular strength as a modifiable risk factor would be of great interest from a public health perspective. Copyright © 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anti-HMGCR myopathy is a subtype of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, typically associated with exposure to statins, although a sizable minority in some cohorts are statin-naive. Although the clinical features of acute- or subacute-onset symmetrical proximal muscle weakness mimic those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, necrotizing myopathy is distinguished by the histopathological findings of muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration with little to no accompanying inflammation. Several recent studies of patients with anti-HMGCR myopathy have identified a slightly increased risk of cancer. Most patients require aggressive immunotherapy, usually as a combination of 2 or 3 immunosuppressant drugs. We report a case of a statin-naive paraneoplastic anti-HMGCR myopathy, who unlike other reported cases, responded to a single dose of 1000 mg of intravenous rituximab and subsequent chemoradiation therapy for an underlying lung cancer, despite failing to completely respond to prior high-dose oral prednisone and methotrexate.

AB  - Sarcopenic dysphagia is characterized by the loss of swallowing muscle mass and function associated with generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. In this report, the authors describe a patient with possible sarcopenic dysphagia after lung cancer surgery and was treated subsequently by rehabilitation nutrition. A 71-year-old man with lung cancer experienced complications of an acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia after surgery. He was ventilated artificially, and a tracheotomy was performed. The patient received diagnoses of malnutrition, severe sarcopenia, and possible sarcopenic dysphagia. His dysphagia was improved by a combination of dysphagia rehabilitation including physical and speech therapy and an improvement in nutrition initiated by a nutrition support team. Finally, he no longer had dysphagia and malnutrition. Sarcopenic dysphagia should be considered in patients with sarcopenia and dysphagia. Rehabilitation nutrition using a combination of both rehabilitation and nutritional care management is presumptively useful for treating sarcopenic dysphagia.

AB  - A 65-year-old man had suffered from systemic erythema from November 2008 and had noticed gradually progressing weakness in the upper and lower limbs. He received medical treatment in another hospital but his symptoms did not improve. He was admitted to our hospital for treatment of diabetes in June 2009, and his chest X-ray images and CT scans showed a mass shadow in the right upper lobe with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We performed bronchoscopy, and diagnosed small cell lung cancer (T2N2M1, stage IV). However, he had hand grip weakness and continuing upper and lower limb muscle weakness, and therefore electromyography was performed, which showed the presence of waxing in the right leg. Subsequently, a diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome was made. As he also showed ataxia of the left lower extremity, we also diagnosed paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We gave the patient chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and etoposide which resulted in the disappearance of his waxing, and his grip strength and erythema immediately improved with regression of the tumor after 1 course of chemotherapy. We report a case of small cell lung cancer associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and erythema which presented as paraneoplastic syndrome, which improved with chemotherapy.

AB  - Cancer-associated cachexia is a complex metabolic condition characterized by the progressive loss of body fat and deterioration of muscle mass. Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cachexia are incompletely understood, previous studies have suggested mitochondrial dysfunction in murine models of cancer cachexia. To better understand the metabolic shift in cancer-induced cachexia, we studied the effects of enhanced oxidative capacity on muscle wasting using transgenic mice over-expressing Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) in skeletal muscle in a Lewis lung carcinoma-implanted model. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis was observed in the skeletal muscle of tumor-implanted mice. However, these increases did not prevent or reverse muscle wasting in mice harboring tumors. Moreover, tumor size was increased in muscle PGC-1alpha over-expressing mice. We found similar levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in tumor-implanted animals, which was not affected by increased muscle expression of PGC-1alpha. Our data indicated that increased mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle is not sufficient to rescue tumor-associated, acute muscle loss, and could promote tumor growth, possibly through the release of myokines.

AB  - RATIONALE: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) as a paraneoplastic manifestation of small cell lung cancer has been published several times, while paraneoplastic GBS accompanied by pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare., PATIENT CONCERNS: An 80-year-old male was hospitalized with a 2-week history of fever and 10-day history of progressive ascending muscle weakness in the legs and arms. The patient felt weakness in legs at first when he was still able to move around, but the symptoms gradually progressed to the arms. At the time of office visit, he could no longer walk or hold up objects, and had absent deep-tendon reflexes as well as weakened left lung breath sounds., DIAGNOSES: Confirmed by the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and electromyography examination, the patient was originally admitted into our hospital for GBS. However, radiology and histological examination revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. He was relatively old and confirmed to have pulmonary adenocarcinoma with simultaneously detected GBS, so was considered to be a paraneoplastic syndrome, rather than pure GBS., INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 80 mg Qd for 10 consecutive days, which resulted in improvement in arms, then tapering to lower doses for 3 months., OUTCOMES: The patient showed temporary relief until relapse 6 months later, when the patient gave up treatment., LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma that was diagnosed based on Guillain-Barre-like syndrome, which is very difficult to diagnose and treat. We suggest that elderly patients with GBS should not be considered as simple GBS and should be thoroughly examined to exclude systemic diseases, especially paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. In addition, the elderly should be screened regularly for tumor markers.

AB  - Cancer-associated muscle weakness is a poorly understood phenomenon, and there is no effective treatment. Here we find that seven different mouse models of human osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers, as well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, released from the bone surface as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-beta signaling, TGF-beta release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated with increased TGF-beta activity. Thus, pathological TGF-beta release from bone contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force production.

AB  - A 67-year-old man was admitted due to weakness, coughing, shortness of breath and fever. He had decreased breath sounds in the left lung and muscle weakness in the lower and upper extremities. Chest imaging showed a mass in the left lung, and a biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer. The nerve conduction velocity was decreased, and anti-GM1 IgG antibodies were positive. The patient showed a temporary neurologic recovery following the administration of cancer chemotherapy, although he eventually died of progression of lung cancer. As a result of the almost simultaneous symptomatic development of lung cancer and Guillain-Barre syndrome, this case may be considered to involve a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.

AB  - We report an unusual case of T 0 N 2 M 0 small cell lung cancer in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). A 52-year-old man began to notice muscle weakness in a left limb in January 1996, which was followed by muscle weakness in his left arm and fingers, appetite loss, and general fatigue. An electromyogram (EMG) showed the waxing phenomenon in response to high-frequency repetitive stimulation. Lambest-Eaton myasthenic syndrome was diagnosed, based on his symptoms and EMG findings. Chest computed tomography (CT) was done, and left paratracheal, tracheobronchial, subaortic, and hilar lymphadenopathy were found. No mass was seen in either lung field. Cytologic examination of the sputum and bronchial lavage fluid were done, but no malignant cells were found Small cell lung cancer was diagnosed after thoracoscopic resection of the subaortic lymph nodes. No metastases were detected by bone scintigraphy, abdominal CT, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Complete response and resolution of symptoms were obtained by chemotherapy and irradiation.

AB  - Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of secreted proteins, is a potent negative regulator of myogenesis. Free myostatin induces the phosphorylation of the Smad family of transcription factors, which, in turn, regulates gene expression, via the canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway. There is, however, emerging evidence that myostatin can regulate gene expression independent of Smad signaling. As such, we acquired global gene expression data from the gastrocnemius muscle of C57BL/6 mice following a 6-day treatment with recombinant myostatin compared with vehicle-treated animals. Of the many differentially expressed genes, the myostatin-associated decrease (-11.20-fold; P < 0.05) in the noncoding metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) was the most significant and the most intriguing because of numerous reports describing its novel role in regulating cell growth. We therefore sought to further characterize the role of Malat1 expression in skeletal muscle myogenesis. RT-PCR-based quantification of C2C12 and primary human skeletal muscle cells revealed a significant and persistent upregulation (4- to 7-fold; P < 0.05) of Malat1 mRNA during the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Conversely, targeted knockdown of Malat1 using siRNA suppressed myoblast proliferation by arresting cell growth in the G(0)/G(1) phase. These results reveal Malat1 as novel downstream target of myostatin with a considerable ability to regulate myogenesis. The identification of new targets of myostatin will have important repercussions for regenerative biology through inhibition and/or reversal of muscle atrophy and wasting diseases.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that manifests with muscle weakness, autonomic and bulbar dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking drugs. The objective of this study is to review perioperative outcomes on a series of patients with LEMS., DESIGN: The medical records of surgical patients with LEMS from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2012, were retrospectively reviewed., SETTING: Major academic hospital., PATIENTS: Surgical patients with LEMS., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients underwent 60 surgeries, with most performed to diagnose or treat lung malignancy (n = 31; 51.7%). Equal number of patients had LEMS associated with small cell lung cancer (n = 16; 43.2%) or an autoimmune process (n = 16; 43.2%), with the remainder having various malignancies. Neuromuscular blocking drug medications were used in 23 (38.3%) of cases, including 8 patients who were not treated for LEMS symptoms. Four patients (11%) had respiratory complications. Interestingly, 3 patients were either undiagnosed or not treated for LEMS at the time of perioperative complication, and developed weakness after use of neuromuscular blocking drugs., CONCLUSION: Patients with LEMS have increased sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking drugs. The risk for the development of prolonged muscle weakness or postoperative respiratory failure after being exposed to neuromuscular blocking drugs is increased in patients with undiagnosed or untreated LEMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The selection of later-line treatment for older patients with AJCC (version 7) stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel is approved with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC and subgroup analysis of phase 3 data has suggested superior survival in older patients., METHODS: The authors conducted a phase 2 study of nab-paclitaxel in 42 patients aged >=70 years who had been treated previously with a platinum doublet regimen; patients also could have received a PD-1 inhibitor. The primary endpoint of the current study was grade 3 to 5 toxicity (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). In addition to response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), geriatric assessments also were performed before and during treatment, associations between baseline sarcopenia and outcomes were explored, and changes in T lymphocyte p16 before and during treatment were measured. The authors also performed a retrospective subgroup analysis of 19 older patients who were treated with nab-paclitaxel as part of a larger, randomized, phase 2 study; data were not combined., RESULTS: The rate of grade 3 to 5 toxicities was 33.7%. The most common grade 3 to 5 toxicities were decreased white blood cell count (11.9%), neutropenia (9.5%), and fatigue (11.9%). The response rate was 34.2% (2.6% complete response rate and 31.6% partial response rate). The median PFS was 5.2 months and the median OS was 9.3 months. Adverse prognostic factors were common: 42% of patients were frail and 39% of patients were prefrail, whereas 21% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 and 27% were sarcopenic. Only frailty was found to be predictive of inferior survival. A subgroup analysis of 19 older patients treated with nab-paclitaxel alone in a prior trial demonstrated a response rate of 15.8%, a PFS of 4.2 months, and an OS of 13.6 months., CONCLUSIONS: Fit and prefrail older patients with stage IV NSCLC should be considered for treatment with nab-paclitaxel after disease progression with doublet chemotherapy.

AB  - Introduction. Recent work revealed the development of marked muscle fiber weakness in the diaphragm, but not in the non-respiratory latissimus dorsi, during thoracic surgery. To disentangle the molecular processes that underlie the development of diaphragm muscle fiber weakness during thoracic surgery, we studied changes in the gene expression profile. Methods. Serial biopsies from the diaphragm and the latissimus dorsi muscle were obtained from four patients during thoracotomy for resection of a tumor in the right lung. Biopsies were taken as soon as the diaphragm had been exposed (t0) and again after two hours (t2). Gobal differences in gene expression in diaphragm biopsies were assessed by microarray analysis. Results . 346 differentially expressed gene transcripts were found in the diaphragm at t2 vs. t0. Pathway analysis revealed that genes associated with inflammation (83 genes; p<0.0001) and cell death (118 genes, p<0.0001) pathways were significantly overexpressed at t2. Of the 346 differentially expressed genes in the diaphragm at t2, 258 were also differential in the latissimus dorsi muscle, with the direction of change being identical for all differentially expressed genes. In addition, latissimus dorsi showed exclusive upregula-ton of negative regulators of cell death. Conclusions . Two hours of thoracic surgery result in rapid and profound changes in expression of inflammatory response and apoptotic genes in the diaphragm. The apoptotic response was stronger in the diaphragm than in the latissiums dorsi. These findings suggest that the development of selective diaphragm muscle fiber weakness in these patients might be related to an exaggerated apoptotic response.

AB  - RATIONALE: Postoperative pulmonary complications are significant contributors to morbidity in patients who have undergone upper abdominal, thoracic, or cardiac surgery. The pathophysiology of these complications might involve postoperative inspiratory muscle weakness. The nature of postoperative inspiratory muscle weakness is unknown., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of surgery on the functioning of the diaphragm, the main muscle of inspiration., METHODS: Serial biopsies from the diaphragm and the latissimus dorsi muscle were obtained from 6 patients during thoracotomy for resection of a tumor in the right lung. Biopsies were taken as soon as the diaphragm had been exposed (t(0)) and again after 2 hours (t(2)). The contractile performance of demembranated muscle fibers, as well as fiber morphology and markers for proteolysis, was determined., RESULTS: In all patients, the force-generating capacity of diaphragm muscle fibers at t(2) was significantly reduced (~35%) compared with that at t(0), with a more pronounced force loss in type 2 fibers compared with type 1 fibers. Diaphragm weakness was not part of a generalized muscle weakness as contractile performance of latissimus dorsi fibers was preserved at t(2). Diaphragm fiber size and myofibrillar structure were not different at t(2) compared with t0, but myosin heavy chain type 2 was significantly reduced at t(2) and MuRF-1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated at t(2)., CONCLUSIONS: Only 2 hours of thoracic surgery causes marked, and selective, diaphragm muscle fiber weakness.

AB  - PURPOSE: A tumor-derived proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) is suggested to be a potent catabolic factor in skeletal muscle of mice and humans. We aimed to establish the clinical significance of PIF in cancer patients and to elucidate its structural features., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PIF was detected in human urine using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and related to clinical outcomes. PIF immunoaffinity-purified using the mAb was purified/separated using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Ten human cancer cell lines were tested for expression of mRNA encoding PIF core peptide., RESULTS: PIF immunoreactivity was present in 160 of 262 patients with advanced cancers of the lung, esophagus/stomach, and other organs. In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of 181 lung cancer patients, PIF was unrelated to survival; PIF status was also unrelated to skeletal muscle loss confirmed by computed tomography imaging. PIF was seen in 16 of 24 patients with chronic heart failure and thus is not exclusive to malignant disease. In-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis of immunoaffinity purified PIF from cancer patients consistently identified human albumin and immunoglobulins. We showed nonspecific binding of purified albumin and immunoglobulins to the anti-PIF mAb, which is thus not a useful tool for PIF detection or purification in humans. Finally, the human PIF core peptide was detected in human cancer cell lines using reverse transcription-PCR and nucleotide sequencing; however, none of the amplified products had a site for the glycosylation critical to the proteolysis-inducing activity of murine PIF., CONCLUSIONS: A putative human homologue of murine PIF and its role in human cancer cachexia cannot be verified.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketoconazole treatment in the management of patients with paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome (CS) secondary to ectopic adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) production by malignant neoplasms (ECS)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken for 15 consecutive patients with ECS treated with ketoconazole. Strict criteria were defined for diagnosis of ECS and for clinical, biochemical, and hormonal responses., RESULTS: There were four women and 11 men with a median age of 59 years (range, 44 to 84). Eleven patients had primary lung cancer (nine small-cell [SCLC], one mixed SCLC/non-SCLC, and one non-SCLC); two had carcinoid tumors (one bronchial, one pancreatic); one had hepatocellular carcinoma; and one had medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Eight patients had ECS diagnosed at tumor presentation. Clinical findings included proximal muscle weakness (n = 10), peripheral edema (n = 8), and hypertension (n = 8). Biochemical abnormalities included hypokalemia (n = 14), metabolic alkalosis (n = 13), and new or worsened diabetes mellitus (n = 10). Patients received ketoconazole in dosages of 400 to 1,200 mg/d titrated by changes in urinary free-cortisol (UFC) levels for a median duration of 26 days (range, 3 to 1,059), and nine also received chemotherapy with ketoconazole. Hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension improved in the majority of patients. Ten patients had a hormonal response, with seven complete responses (median duration, 25 days; range, 6 to 989). The occurrence of symptomatic hypoadrenalism was definite in three patients and probable in one. Most patients died of progressive malignant disease accompanied by escape from hormonal control by ketoconazole. The median survival duration of the group was 19 weeks (range, 1 to 154)., CONCLUSION: Ketoconazole results in biochemical and hormonal improvement for most patients with ECS. It has few adverse effects, but may impair the cortisol response to stress. For that reason, replacement corticosteroids should be considered for patients with hormonal response, and moderate- to high-dose corticosteroids should be given for any potential stress situations. The ultimate control of the syndrome is dependent on successful treatment of the underlying tumor.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Insulin resistance of protein anabolism has been speculated to underlie the skeletal muscle wasting characteristic of cancer cachexia. We tested whether insulin resistance is present in cachectic lung cancer patients and if a sustained, physiological elevation of amino acids with hyperinsulinemia would compensate for it., METHODS: Whole-body [(13)C]leucine and [(3)H]glucose kinetics were assessed in 10 male non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 10 healthy matched controls during a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp under conditions of isoaminoacidemia followed by hyperaminoacidemia., RESULTS: Postabsorptive glucose and protein kinetics were comparable between groups. Glucose uptake was significantly lower in NSCLC patients during hyperinsulinemia. During concurrent isoaminoacidemia, protein breakdown was suppressed in both, but rates were elevated in NSCLC; rates of synthesis did not change, resulting in reduced net protein balance (synthesis - breakdown) in response to insulin in NSCLC. With subsequent hyperaminoacidemia, synthesis increased significantly with no further change in breakdown, resulting in similar increase in net balance between groups., CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC patients with moderate cachexia showed considerable insulin resistance of glucose and of whole-body protein anabolism. Their anabolic protein response was stimulated normally by hyperaminoacidemia. Thus, ample provision of amino acids is a feasible strategy to overcome the protein anabolic failure of cancer cachexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To enhance the acknowledgement of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer., METHODS: Retrospective case analysis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer in our hospital., RESULTS: The characteristics of electromyography for Lambert-Eaton syndrome was reduction in action potential amplitude after repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation at low frequency and increased amplitude at high frequency. There were 10 cases of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer,9 male and 1 female with an average age of 57.6+/-4.9.Nine of 10 cases were among 50 to 69.All patients except one experienced myasthenia,mainly in lower extremities,2 to 36 months (median:6 months) before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.Treatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome., CONCLUSIONS: Improving the recognition of Lambert-Eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.

AB  - Background: Cachexia, a wasting syndrome, is most commonly observed in individuals with advanced cancer including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, etc. The characteristic sign of cachexia is muscle atrophy. To date, effective countermeasures have been still deficiency to alleviate muscle atrophy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important regulators of muscle atrophy. Therefore, the effects of a naturally antioxidant, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), were explored on muscle atrophy induced by cachexia in the present study., Methods: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced C2C12 myotubes atrophy model was constructed. The atrophied C2C12 myotubes were dealt with the presence or absence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant for ROS abolition) (5 mM) or PQQ (80 micro M) for 24 hours. ROS content was determined by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. The diameter of myotubes was analyzed by myosin heavy chain (MHC) staining. The protein levels of MHC, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF-1) in each group were observed by Western blotting., Results: First, ROS generation was enhanced in C2C12 myotubes treated with TNF-alpha. NAC treatments significantly avoided the reduction in the diameter of C2C12 myotubes, and concomitantly increased MHC levels, and decreased ROS contents, MuRF1 and MAFbx levels. These data suggested that the increased ROS induced by TNF-alpha might play a central role in muscle wasting. PQQ (a naturally occurring antioxidant) administration inhibited C2C12 myotubes atrophy induced by TNF-alpha, as evidenced by the increase of the diameter of C2C12 myotubes, together with increased MHC levels and decreased ROS, MAFbx and MuRF-1 levels., Conclusions: PQQ resists atrophic effect dependent on, at least in part, decreased ROS in skeletal muscle treated with TNF-alpha.

AB  - A 63-year-old man with Eaton-Lambert syndrome manifested by marked respiratory failure was reported. He began to notice blepharoptosis and diplopia in September, 1987, followed by weakness and easy fatigability in bulbar, neck and limb muscles in association with impotence by February, 1988. On admission in August, 1988, Gowers' sign, decreased tendon reflexes and muscle weakness improved by the injection of edrophonium were found. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody was negative. Single muscle action potential evoked in the thenar muscle was abnormally low in amplitude with the stimulation of the median nerve: repetitive nerve stimulation study revealed the waning at the low rates, but the waxing at the high rate (30 Hz), suggesting the diagnosis of Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Early gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma) was diagnosed from needle biopsy specimens in August, 1988, but no other neoplasm including thymoma or lung cancer was found. After subtotal gastric resection in September, 1988, he failed into respiratory failure, requiring artificial ventilation for seven months. Plasmapheresis and drugs such as anticholinesterase, guanidine hydrochloride, and corticosteroid were ineffective for the recovery from weakness in respiratory muscle. Lung cancer was suspected, based on a chest X-ray in March, 1989, and one month later he died of pneumonia. At autopsy, small cell carcinoma of the lung was observed, but there was neither recurrence nor metastasis of the gastric cancer. Emphasis was placed on the respiratory failure in Eaton-Lambert syndrome which has rarely been reported.

AB  - Cancer is a prevalent disease with high mortality and morbidity. Muscle atrophy is a severe and disabling clinical condition that frequently accompanies cancer development such as muscle atrophy in pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. The majority of cancer patients are accompanied with cachexia. Cancer-associated cachexia is characterized by weight loss and muscle atrophy. Muscle wasting is a pivotal feature of cancer cachexia. Muscle atrophy refers to the reduction of muscle mass caused by muscle itself or the dysfunction of nervous system. Muscle atrophy causes serious clinical consequences such as physical impairment, poor life quality, reduced tolerance to treatments, and short survival. Although many reports have studied cancer-related muscle atrophy, there is still no clear understanding of it. Here we will describe the prevalence, mechanisms, pathophysiological effects, and current clinical treatments of muscle atrophy in cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the association between sarcopenia (skeletal muscle depletion) and outcomes in patients with lung cancer varies across studies. We aimed to systematically review the prognostic value of sarcopenia in lung cancer., METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 23, 2018 to identify retrospective or prospective cohort studies. We applied the Quality in Prognostic Studies instrument to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. We examined the heterogeneity and publication bias and performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses., RESULTS: We included 13 studies (1,810 participants). The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia was 43% in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 52% in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Sarcopenia was associated with a shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.68-2.94). This association existed for both NSCLC (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.79-3.68) and SCLC (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.17-2.14). Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of shorter OS in both stage I-II NSCLC (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.68-6.23) and stage III-IV NSCLC (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14-4.24). However, sarcopenia was not an independent predictor of disease-free survival in patients with NSCLC (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.44-3.69)., CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with lung cancer (approximately one in two) and an important predictor of impaired OS in patients with SCLC or with different stages of NSCLC.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with typical cutaneous manifestations. It has been proposed that dermatomyositis may be caused by autoimmune responses to viral infections. Previous studies have shown an association between dermatomyositis and malignant tumors such as ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. However, a chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection associated with dermatomyositis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been very rarely reported. Here, we report a rare case of dermatomyositis coinciding with HBV-associated HCC. A 55-year-old male was confirmed to have HCC and dermatomyositis based on proximal muscle weakness, typical skin manifestations, elevated muscle enzyme levels, and muscle biopsy findings. This case suggests that HCC and/or a chronic HBV infection may be factors in the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis through a paraneoplastic mechanism.

AB  - We present a 77-year-old woman with myoclonus and epilepsy. She was well until 35 years of age, when she noted an onset of trembling of the legs upon standing. Her symptom slowly progressed, and she felt a difficulty in standing when she was 39-year-old. She had a major motor seizure without an apparent focal onset when she was 46-year-old. She also developed tremor in her hands, and she felt difficulty in holding a glass filled with water. She was admitted to our service for the first time in 1965 when she was 51-year-old. She showed wide-based ataxic gait with truncal titubation. In finger to nose test, myoclonic jerks were induced in the upper extremities. Otherwise neurological examination was unremarkable. She was treated with primidone and phenobarbital, and was discharged for out patient follow up. Her symptoms slowly progressed, and gait and station became more difficult. Mentally she was sound. Three months prior to the present admission, she developed more difficulty in gait, and decrease in food intake. On the 14th of September in 1991, she was seen by a local physician who found an abnormal shadow in her chest X-ray, and she was admitted to our service for further work-up on September 18, 1991. On admission, the patient was a chronically ill and emaciated woman. Her blood pressure was 140/84 mmHg, heart rate 115/minutes and regular, and the body temperature 36.9 degrees C. The palpebral conjunctivae were anemic. No cervical adenopathy was noted. The lung fields were clear, and no heart murmur was audible. The abdomen was soft, and no organomegaly was present. On neurologic examination, she looked somnolent with disorientation to time and place. Her memory was poor, and she could not do well serial 7s. The disc was flat and the ocular movements appeared intact. Other cranial nerves were also unremarkable. She showed diffuse muscle wasting. She was unable to stand or walk. Maintaining the sitting position was also difficult. She was able to raise her arms, but almost unable to move her lower extremities. The precise muscle testing was impossible. No abnormal involuntary movement was seen. Finger to nose test could not be performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - A 75-year-old man had been given a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in March 2005. He had been treated with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and etoposide, and he had showed partial response to treatment. He presented with general fatigue, weakness of the muscles and extremities, skin lesions and finger erythema in April 2006. A muscle biopsy was performed and the pathological findings confirmed dermatomyositis. The findings of his chest X-ray and computed tomography showed an increase in the size of the lung cancer lesion. The tumor size decreased, and creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels also decreased after irinotecan chemotherapy. He was also given prednisolone (1 mg/kg) for prolonged muscle weakness. There are few cases which report dermatomyositis after a diagnosis of SCLC. In the present case, dermatomyositis appeared when the recurrence of SCLC became evident. We believed that the onset of dermatomyositis might be related to the activity level of SCLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma (ASQCC), histologically characterized by intercellular bridge loosening, is recognized as a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). ASQCC may demonstrate a worse prognosis than conventional SQCC. Pulmonary ASQCC is particularly rare; its biological behavior and prognostic data have not been reported., CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical and autopsy findings of a 71-year-old Japanese man with pulmonary ASQCC. Pulmonary lesions, suggestive of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, were radiologically observed 3 and 6 years prior to the patient's most recent hospitalization; however, the patient did not undergo further medical examinations. Upon being discovered unconscious, the patient was admitted to our hospital. Dehydration and lower limb muscle weakness were noted, as were laboratory findings of coagulation abnormalities and renal dysfunction. Computed tomography helped confirm a 21-mm peripheral nodule in the upper left lobe of the lung, with associated swollen lymph nodes in the bilateral hilar, mediastinal, and para-aortic regions. Brain and spinal lesions, suggestive of neurological disturbances, were not found. Small cell lung carcinoma was suspected, upon admission, but high serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen and cytokeratin-19 fragments were present. Therefore, advanced lung cancer, possibly SQCC, was diagnosed. The patient was treated with best supportive therapy, and died one month after admission. Hypercalcemia and high serum levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) titers were observed. Progressive renal insufficiency was absent due to improved renal function subsequent to hydration. An autopsy helped confirm the left lung tumor as an ASQCC associated with pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis and multiple metastases in the lungs and lymph nodes. Skin lesions suggesting malignant tumors were absent. The metastatic lesions consisted largely of acantholytic tumor cells, and the lungs showed usual interstitial pneumonia pattern; vasculitis was absent., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of pulmonary ASQCC resulting in an aggressive clinical course, with marked lymphogenous metastases and PTHrP-associated hypercalcemia. The high serum MPO-ANCA titers were clinicopathologically insignificant, but may have been related to the pulmonary interstitial lesion. Pulmonary ASQCC represents a highly malignant subset of lung cancer.

AB  - Sarcopenia and cachexia are muscle wasting syndromes associated with aging and with many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). While mechanisms are complex, these conditions are often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased Ang II levels and cachexia, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment improves weight loss. It was found that Ang II infusion in rodents leads to skeletal muscle wasting. Ang II increases cytokines and circulating hormones, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, serum amyloid-A and glucocorticoids, which regulate muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ang II-induced muscle wasting is caused by alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, enhanced muscle protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and decreased appetite resulting from the downregulation of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides, such as Npy and orexin. Ang II also inhibits 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity and disrupts normal energy balance via the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphatase PP2Calpha. Furthermore, Ang II inhibits skeletal muscle stem (satellite) cell proliferation, leading to lowered muscle regenerative capacity. Distinct satellite cell angiotensin receptor subtypes have different effects on different stages of differentiation and are critical for the regulation of muscle regeneration. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in mechanisms underlying cachexia in chronic disease states, and it is a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in patients with diseases such as CHF and CKD.

AB  - Cachexia, observed in most cancer patients, is a syndrome that includes wasting of bodily energy reserves and is characterized by muscle atrophy and fat loss. We have previously demonstrated that isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, prevent muscle wasting in tumor-bearing mice. In this study, we examined the effect of morin, a flavonoid, on cachexia. The wet weight and myofiber size of muscles in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell-bearing mice fed a normal diet were decreased, compared with those in control mice fed a normal diet. In contrast, intake of morin prevented the reduction of muscle wet weight and myofiber size. Moreover, the tumor weight in mice fed the morin diet was lower than that in mice fed the normal diet. Both cell viability and protein synthetic ability of LLC cells were reduced by treatment with morin, but C2C12 myotubes were not affected. Binding assay using morin-conjugated magnetic beads identified ribosomal protein S10 (RPS10) as a target protein of morin. Consistent with the result of morin treatment, knockdown of RPS10 suppressed LLC cell viability. These results suggest that morin indirectly prevents muscle wasting induced by cancer cachexia by suppressing cancer growth via binding to RPS10. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed in a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, myelitis, sensory neuropathy and cerebellar degeneration secondary to small cell lung cancer. A 67-year-old male smoker developed orthostatic dizziness 6 months prior to admission. Over the following months, his wife noticed that he became forgetful and confused. Over the next three weeks, he became unable to sit or stand unaided and admitted to our service. On admission, he was lethargic and disoriented in time and place. Neurological examination revealed marked limb weakness with distal dominant muscle atrophy. A chest radiograph demonstrated a mass in the right middle lobe and a bronchial biopsy revealed a small cell carcinoma. CT scan and MRI of the brain revealed abnormalities in the bilateral medial temporal lobes and putamen. He was treated with anti-cancer chemotherapy, but died of respiratory failure after 13 months illness. Postmortem examination showed a mass in the right middle lobe of the lung. No tumor metastases were noted in the nervous tissue. Microscopical examinations of the nervous system revealed neuronal loss, astrogliosis and perivascular and parenchymatous lymphocytic infiltration in the hippocampus, subiculum, amygdala, putamen, medulla oblongata, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Loss of Purkinje cells was also seen in the cerebellum without lymphocytic infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's serum and CSF by the use of adult rat brain revealed immunoreactivity at the hippocampal pyramidal neurons CA3 and CA4. At the higher dilution, neuronal nuclei were specifically stained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Skeletal muscle atrophy, a conventional clinical feature in patients with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis and severe burns, is defined as a reduction in muscle mass. During atrophy, the protein degradation is abnormally activated and the aberrance between protein synthesis and protein degradation results in muscle atrophy. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules, serve an important role in the regulation of muscle atrophy. Further studies have indicated the implications of the ubiquitin-proteasome and PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathways and myogenic regulatory factors in miRNA-mediated muscle atrophy. Therefore, in this review, the effects and molecular mechanisms of miRNAs on muscle atrophy are summarized, leading to the suggestion that miRNAs may serve as potential therapeutic targets in muscle atrophy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicting survival of patients with spinal metastases would help stratify treatments from aggressive to palliation., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether sarcopenia predicts survival in patients with lung, breast, prostate, or multiple myeloma spinal metastases., METHODS: Psoas muscle measurements in patients with spinal metastasis were taken from computed tomography scans at 2 time points: at first episode of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and from the most recent scan available. Overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated with multivariate cox proportional hazards regression analyses., RESULTS: In 417 patients with spinal metastases, 40% had lung cancer, 27% breast, 21% prostate, and 11% myeloma. Overall survival was not associated with age, sex, ethnicity, levels treated, or SBRT volume. Multivariate analysis showed patients in the lowest psoas tertile had shorter survival (222 d, 95% CI = 185-323 d) as compared to the largest tertile (579 d, 95% CI = 405-815 d), (HR1.54, P = .005). Median psoas size as a cutoff value was also strongly predictive for survival (HR1.48, P = .002). Survival was independent of tumor histology. The psoas/vertebral body ratio was also successful in predicting overall survival independent of tumor histology and gender (HR1.52, P < .01). Kaplan-Meier survival curves visually represent survival (P = .0005)., CONCLUSION: In patients with spine metastases, psoas muscle size as a hallmark of frailty/sarcopenia is an objective, simple, and effective way to identify patients who are at risk for shorter survival, regardless of tumor histology. This information can be used to help with surgical decision making in patients with advanced cancer, as patients with small psoas sizes are at higher risk of death.

AB  - We report the clinical and electrophysiological findings in seven patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). All patients were males aged 40-73 years old. Six presented proximal muscle weakness and one both proximal and distal. The tendon reflexes were absent in four patients, depressed in two and normal in one patient. Three patients presented ophthalmic and four autonomic symptoms. The syndrome was diagnosed 3-12 months after the onset of symptoms in six patients and 4 years later in one. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative in all patients. Voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (VGCC) were measured in five patients and were positive in four. All patients had low compound muscle action potential (CMAP) at rest, a decrement in CMAP amplitude of 20-47% at 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation, and an increment of 200-700% at 40 Hz. In three patients the syndrome was associated with histologically verified small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In the younger patient (40 years old), a lymph node biopsy performed nine years before the diagnosis of LEMS, had shown an atypical microcellular cancer of undetermined origin, which was treated with chemotherapy. LEMS 9 years after the diagnosis of cancer has not been described previously. The fifth patient had a two years history of bladder cancer (grade II). Three years after the diagnosis of LEMS he presented chronic lymphogenic leukemia. No malignancy was found in the remaining 2 patients.

AB  - Upregulation of ubiquitin ligase atrogin1/MAFbx and muscle wasting are hallmarks of cancer cachexia; however, the underlying mechanism is undefined. Here, we describe a novel signalling pathway through which Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) induces atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation and muscle wasting. C2C12 myotubes treated with LLC-conditioned medium (LCM) rapidly activates p38 MAPK and AKT while inactivating FoxO1/3, resulting in atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation, myosin heavy chain loss, and myotube atrophy. The p38alpha/beta MAPK inhibitor SB202190 blocks the catabolic effects. Upon activation, p38 associates with C/EBPbeta resulting in its phosphorylation and binding to a C/EBPbeta-responsive cis-element in the atrogin1/MAFbx gene promoter. The promoter activity is stimulated by LCM via p38beta-mediated activation of the C/EBPbeta-responsive cis-element, independent of the adjacent FoxO1/3-responsive cis-elements in the promoter. In addition, p38 activation is observed in the muscle of LLC tumour-bearing mice, and SB202190 administration blocks atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation and muscle protein loss. Furthermore, C/EBPbeta(-/-) mice are resistant to LLC tumour-induced atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation and muscle wasting. Therefore, activation of the p38beta MAPK-C/EBPbeta signalling pathway appears a key component of the pathogenesis of LLC tumour-induced cachexia.

AB  - UNLABELLED:, BACKGROUND: The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) family plays pivotal roles in skeletal muscle metabolism. Recent evidence revealed that p38alpha and p38beta exert paradoxical effects on muscle protein homeostasis. However, it is unknown why p38beta, but not p38alpha, is capable of mediating muscle catabolism via selective activation of the C/EBPbeta that upregulates atrogin1/MAFbx., METHODS: Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was carried out to identify p38alpha- and p38beta-mediated phosphorylation sites in C/EBPbeta. Chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to evaluate p38alpha and p38beta effect on C/EBPbeta binding to the atrogin1/MAFbx promoter. Overexpression or siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of p38alpha and p38beta, and site-directed mutagenesis or knockout of C/EBPbeta, were used to analyze the roles of these kinases in muscle catabolism in C2C12 myotubes and mice., RESULTS: Cellular expression of constitutively active p38alpha or p38beta resulted in phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta at multiple serine and threonine residues; however, only p38beta phosphorylated Thr-188, which had been known to be critical to the DNA-binding activity of C/EBPbeta. Only p38beta, but not p38alpha, activated C/EBPbeta-binding to the atrogin1/MAFbx promoter. A C/EBPbeta mutant in which Thr-188 was replaced by alanine acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation induced by either p38beta or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell-conditioned medium (LCM). In addition, knockdown of p38beta specifically inhibited C/EBPbeta activation and atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation induced by LCM. Finally, expression of active p38beta in mouse tibialis anterior specifically induced C/EBPbeta phosphorylation at Thr-188, atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation and muscle mass loss, which were blocked in C/EBPbeta-null mice., CONCLUSIONS: The alpha and beta isoforms of p38 MAPK are capable of recognizing distinct phosphorylation sites in a substrate. The unique capacity of p38beta in mediating muscle catabolism is due to its capability in phosphorylating Thr-188 of C/EBPbeta.

AB  - Cancer-induced cachexia, characterized by muscle wasting, is a lethal metabolic syndrome with undefined etiology. Current consensus is that multiple factors contribute to cancer-induced muscle wasting, and therefore therapy requires combinational strategies. Here, we show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates cancer-induced muscle wasting by directly activating muscle catabolism as well as stimulating an innate immune response in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and targeting TLR4 alone effectively abrogate muscle wasting. Utilizing specific siRNAs we observed that LLC cell-conditioned medium (LCM)-treated C2C12 myotubes underwent a rapid catabolic response in a TLR4-dependent manner, including activation of the p38 MAPK-C/EBPbeta signaling pathway as well as the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways, resulting in myotube atrophy. Utilizing a reporter cell-line it was confirmed that LCM activated TLR4. These results suggest that LLC-released cachexins directly activate muscle catabolism via activating TLR4 on muscle cells independent of immune responses. Critically, LLC tumor-bearing TLR4-/- mice were spared from muscle wasting due to a blockade in muscle catabolic pathways. Further, tumor-induced elevation of circulating TNFalpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was abolished in TLR4-/- mice. These data suggest that TLR4 is a central mediator and therapeutic target of cancer-induced muscle wasting.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor with the potential to secrete various peptides or hormones that can lead to paraneoplastic syndromes, such as Ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS). Because of the aggressive nature of the syndrome and its atypical features, ECS in small-cell lung cancer is difficult to diagnose and has a poor prognosis. We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who presented with severe hypokalemia, proximal muscle weakness, peripheral edema, metabolic alkalosis, and worsening hyperglycemia. The patient was eventually diagnosed with stage IV primary small-cell lung cancer and survived three months after diagnosis. We reviewed published articles to determine any new diagnostic techniques or advantages in the treatment regimen. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by fluctuating proximal limb muscle weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes and various autonomic symptoms. LEMS is reportedly the most common neurological paraneoplastic syndrome. This is the case report of a patient with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who developed LEMS. A 68-year-old male patient presented with a 6-month history of progressive weakness of the proximal limbs and a 2-month history of xerostomia. The patient was admitted to the Department of Neurology of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region (Shenyang, China). The symptoms of the patient were not relieved with supportive therapy. Further laboratory tests, electrodiagnostic studies, chest computed tomography and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of LEMS in the presence of SCLC. Following administration of two cycles of rescue chemotherapy with a combination of etoposide and cisplatin, the symptoms of the patient were gradually relieved and, after six cycles of therapy, the primary malignancy completely regressed. In conclusion, a diagnosis of LEMS may lead to the timely detection of SCLC, significantly improving patient prognosis and survival.

AB  - Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with manifestations of proximal muscle weakness and typical cutaneous skin rash. Patients with DM have a higher incidence rate of cancer, compared with the general population, since DM usually presents as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The present study reports a case of a 69-year-old male patient presenting with typical cutaneous rash and aggravating proximal muscle weakness for 3 months. When first admitted to the Department of Dermatology of Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (Jinan, China), the patient was diagnosed with DM. Subsequently, chest computed tomography scan revealed a neoplasm located in the right upper lobe. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection were then performed. The patient experienced a fast recovery from the surgery. The removal of the neoplasm clearly improved the symptoms of DM. Considering that DM is usually associated with the existence of a tumor, cases of DM require a thorough diagnostic investigation in order to exclude an underlying malignancy.

AB  - Objective: To summarize the clinical experience of vascular repair and reconstruction for treating superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) caused by thoracic tumor., Methods: Between October 2008 and June 2016, 26 patients with thoracic tumor and SVCS were admitted. There were 18 males and 8 females, aged from 27 to 70 years (mean, 45.9 years). Tumor was typed as B1-B3 thymoma in 13 cases, thymic carcinoma in 6 cases, large B-cell lymphoma in 3 cases, T lymphocytic lymphoma in 1 case, malignant teratoma in 1 case, right lung squamous cell carcinoma in 1 case, and carcinoid in 1 case. The tumor diameter ranged from 8 to 15 cm with an average of 10 cm. The patients had different degrees of neck, face, and upper extremity edema, jugular vein distention, and chest wall collateral venous filling. The superior vena cava pressure was 2.45-5.39 kPa. After excision of tumor and invading superior vena cava, 7 patients underwent superior vena cava reconstruction and 19 patients underwent artificial vascular replacement., Results: There was no perioperative death, and the symptoms of superior vena cava obstruction were eliminated. Postoperative pulmonary infection, respiratory muscle weakness, and right chylothorax occurred in 4 cases, 1 case, and 1 case respectively. Twenty-four patients were followed up 2-92 months (mean, 37 months), and 2 patients failed to be followed up. At 1, 3, and 5 years, the survival rate was 83.3% (20/24), 41.7% (10/24), and 25% (6/24), respectively. In 6 patients with 5-year survival, there were 1 case of type B1 thymoma, 3 cases of type B3 thymoma, and 2 cases of large B-cell lymphoma., Conclusion: For preoperative evaluation of SVCS caused by resectable thoracic tumors, vascular repair and recons-truction technique can be used to quickly and effectively relieve the clinical symptoms and improve the quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, modified Taohongsiwu decoction, versus pyridoxine on patients with hand-foot syndrome (HFS) from capecitabine, sorafenib, and gefitinib chemotherapy for gastric, lung, breast, colon, or rectal cancer. Also, to compare quality of life of patients in each group., METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly to group A or B. Group A was given modified Taohongsiwu decoction to soak hands and feet for 30 min, once daily. Group B was given 100 mg pyridoxine orally, twice daily. After a 2-week treatment, the therapeutic effect was assessed by observing three major symptoms, including pain, ulceration, and muscular atrophy. This was assessed with the HFS-14 questionnaire., RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the two groups in pain relief, and improvement of daily life, walking, and interpersonal communication (P < 0.01). No significant differences in driving ability or interpersonal relationships were found. After 2 weeks, the effective rate was 88.3% in group A, which was significantly higher than the 50% in group B (P = 0.00)., CONCLUSION: Modified Taohongsiwu decoction is effective in the treatment of patients with HFS. It improves patients' quality of life according to the HFS-14.

AB  - Skeletal muscle wasting occurs in a variety of diseases including diabetes, cancer, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), disuse, and denervation. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is involved in mediating the wasting effect. To date, a causal relationship between TNF-alpha signaling and muscle wasting has been established in animal models. However, results from clinical trials are conflicting. This is partly due to the fact that other factors such as TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are also involved in skeletal muscle wasting. Because muscle wasting is often associated with physical inactivity and reduced food intake, therapeutic interventions will be most effective when multiple approaches are used in conjunction with nutritional support and exercise.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare non-metastatic complications of cancer that have an immune-mediated etiology. The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder, often associated with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which is characterized by reduced quantal release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminals. LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME: The Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is characterized by proximal muscle weakness initially affecting gait, autonomic symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, erectile failure) and augmentation of strength during initial voluntary activation. Symptomatic treatment of the junctional disorder is based on cholinergic drugs, immunosuppression, immunomodulation and physical therapy useful in case of unsuccessful antineoplastic therapy., CASE REPORT: A rare case of ovarian cancer with Eaton-Lambert syndrome is reported. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the gynecologic department, complaining of weakness and pain in her arms and shoulders. Physical therapy resulted in partial improvement. Treatment of paraneoplastic syndrome markedly improves the quality of life of cancer patients. Patients presenting with this syndrome should undergo a careful evaluation for the presence of an occult malignancy.
