AB  - CONTEXT: - Patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia may display evidence of autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease. A recent European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society statement proposed research criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), which includes findings from the clinical, serologic, and morphologic domains., OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the importance of histopathologic criteria within the morphologic domain and to report our methodology for identifying these features., DESIGN: - Patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia at the University of Chicago who underwent surgical lung biopsy or lung transplantation were assessed for IPAF histopathologic features, using the initial pathology interpretation in the electronic records. A focused rereview of available slides by a pulmonary pathologist was then performed for patients who failed to meet IPAF criteria on initial pathology assessment., RESULTS: - Of 422 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 176 (41.7%) underwent surgical lung biopsy or lung transplant. Forty-six of those 176 patients (26.1%) met IPAF criteria by initial pathology interpretation and a positive clinical or serologic feature. Of the remaining 130 patients, 73 (56.2%) met either the clinical or serologic domains without meeting the morphologic domain, whereas 36 (27.7%) had slides available for pathology rereview. This rereview demonstrated nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in 8 of 36 patients (22.2%) and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in 6 of 36 patients (16.7%), resulting in an additional 7 of 36 patients (19.4%) with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that met the IPAF criteria. In IPAF, pulmonary vasculopathy was the most prevalent finding (45 of 84; 53.6%) and predicted increased mortality (hazard ratio, 2.5; P = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: - Using a methodological approach to identifying IPAF pathology, we demonstrate a significant increase in the number of patients meeting IPAF criteria because of focused pathologic review and highlight the prognostic value of the IPAF pathologic findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has recently been defined by an international Taskforce to characterize interstitial lung disease associated with systemic manifestations limited to subtle serological and clinical autoimmune abnormalities and not fulfilling the international criteria for the diagnosis of a given connective tissue disease., OBJECTIVE: to report on a series of patients with IPAF, and to compare their outcome to that of a cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients in a single institution over a 3-year period., RESULTS: Out of 778 consecutive patients with interstitial lung disease, 55% had idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (including 20.1% with IPF), 21.5% had connective tissue disease, and 7.3% had IPAF. Patients (49% of females) had a mean FVC of 64% and a mean DLco of 49%. Serologic criteria for IPAF were the most frequent (93%), followed by "morphologic" criteria (79%), and clinical criteria (47%). Fifty three percent of patients had a NSIP pattern on CT. Nailfold capillaroscopy found giant capillaries in 13/30 patients tested (23%). No significant was found in overall survival between patients with IPAF and those with IPF., CONCLUSION: The recently defined criteria for IPAF are fulfilled by a significant proportion of patients referred for interstitial lung disease. As compared to those with IPF, patients with IPAF are more frequently females, have distinctive characteristics, have relatively frequent abnormalities at nailfold capillaroscopy, with no difference in age or in overall survival. Prospective studies are needed to guide the management of IPAF. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the CT findings and patterns of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) and to assess whether imaging can predict survival for patients with IPAF., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 136 subjects who met the criteria for IPAF and had diagnostic-quality chest CT scans obtained from 2006 to 2015; a total of 74 of these subjects had pathologic samples available for review within 1 year of chest CT examination. CT findings and the presence of an usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern of disease were assessed, as was the UIP pattern noted on pathologic analysis. Analysis of chest CT findings associated with survival was performed using standard univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards methods as well as the unadjusted log-rank test. Survival data were visually presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimator., RESULTS: Most subjects with IPAF (57.4%; 78/136) had a high-confidence diagnosis of a UIP pattern on CT. Substantially fewer subjects (28.7%; 39/136) had a pattern that was inconsistent with UIP noted on CT. The presence of a UIP pattern on CT was associated with smoking (p < 0.01), male sex (p < 0.01), and older age (p < 0.001). Approximately one-fourth of the subjects had a nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis pattern on CT. Of interest, nearly one-tenth of the subjects had a CT pattern that was most consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than the customary CT patterns ascribed to lung disease resulting from connective tissue disease. Most subjects with a possible UIP pattern on CT (83.3%) had UIP diagnosed on the basis of pathologic findings. Focused multivariate analysis showed that honeycombing on CT (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.05-4.47) and pulmonary artery enlargement on CT (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.02-4.20) were independent predictors of survival., CONCLUSION: IPAF most often presents with a UIP pattern on CT and is associated with worse survival when concomitant honeycombing or pulmonary artery enlargement is present.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with autoimmune characteristics and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, particularly usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), do not fit neatly into the category of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), or recently proposed yet to be validated criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Outcomes of these patients are unknown., METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study. Analyses of variance compared differences in mean change in FVC and diffusion capacity (Dlco) over 1 year among 124 well-defined patients (20 patients with positive autoantibodies with or without symptoms of connective tissue disease [AI-ILD], 15 patients with IPAF, 36 patients with CTD-ILD, and 53 patients with IPF with negative CTD serologies [Lone-IPF])., RESULTS: Of the patients, 75% with AI-ILD, 33% with IPAF, and 33% with CTD-ILD had UIP. Initial FVC and Dlco were similarly moderately reduced across groups. Mean change in FVC over 12 months was as follows: -60 mL (IPAF), -110 mL (AI-ILD), -10 mL (CTD-ILD), and -90 mL (Lone-IPF) (P = .52). Mean change in Dlco was as follows: 2.39 mL/mm Hg/min (IPAF), -1.15 mL/mm Hg/min (AI-ILD), -0.27 mL/mm Hg/min (CTD-ILD), and -1.05 mL/mm Hg/min (Lone-IPF) (P < .001). By pattern of disease, the mean change in FVC was as follows: -140 mL (UIP), 10 mL (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia), and 12 mL (unclassifiable/other) (P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant differences in pulmonary function to distinguish between patients with AI-ILD, IPAF, CTD-ILD, and Lone-IPF were observed after 1 year. Longer periods of follow-up are needed to understand the outcomes of these patients. It is not yet clear whether AI-ILD is a distinct phenotype or a variant of the newly proposed entity IPAF.

AB  - To investigate the clinical features, risk factors and outcomes of patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). A total of 1429 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and undifferentiated connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (UCTD-ILD) were screened to identify patients who met IPAF criteria. Clinical, serological, and morphological features of patients with IPAF were characterized. Outcomes between patients with IPAF, UCTD-ILD, and IIP who were divided into idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF groups were compared using survival as an endpoint. Patients with IPAF were much common in young female and had lower percentage of ever smoking and a significantly shorter survival than those with non-IPAF (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that IPAF cohort survival was worse than that in non-IPF (P < 0.001), but better than that in IPF (P < 0.001). In IPAF cohort, the most common systemic symptom and serological abnormality were Raynaud's phenomenon (12.9%) and ANA >= 1:320 (49.2%); the most frequent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern was nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (61.6%). Multivariate analysis indicated that several factors including age, smoking history, organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern in HRCT, and anti-RNP positivity were independently associated with significantly worse survival. IPAF had the distinct clinical features and outcomes compared with other groups of ILD. Additional studies should be needed to explore the underlying autoimmune mechanism and to determine risk stratification in future clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify the prognostic factors for survival in patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) who meet the serological domain of the IPAF criteria., METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 99 IPAF patients who met the serological domain and were hospitalised at the Respiratory Medicine Unit of Kurashiki Central Hospital from 1999 to 2015. The high-resolution computed tomography findings were usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; n = 1), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 63), NSIP with organizing pneumonia (OP) overlap (n = 15), and OP (n = 20). One patient who had radiological UIP pattern, and met the serological and clinical domains was excluded. The clinical characteristics, radiological findings, administered therapy, and prognosis of the remaining 98 IPAF patients who met the serological and morphological domains were analysed., RESULTS: The median age of the 98 IPAF patients was 68 years, and 41 (41.8%) of them were men. Twelve (12.2%) of the 98 IPAF patients developed other characteristics and were diagnosed with connective tissue disease (CTD) later during the median follow-up of 4.5 years. Univariate Cox analysis revealed systemic sclerosis (SSc)-specific and SSc-associated antibodies (ANA nucleolar pattern, ANA centromere pattern, anti-ribonucleoprotein and anti-Scl-70) positive IPAF, radiological NSIP pattern, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lymphocytes >15%, and age as significant prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed radiological NSIP pattern (hazard ratio [HR], 4.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-15.77, p = 0.02) and age (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with worse survival., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that radiological NSIP pattern and age are poor prognostic factors for the survival of IPAF patients. This study suggested that the autoantibodies that are highly specific for certain connective tissue diseases might be less important for the prognosis of IPAF compared with the radiological-pathological patterns. The relatively high proportion of IPAF patients who developed CTD later suggests the importance of careful observation for evolution to CTD in IPAF.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) were recently established for research purposes in a joint statement from the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS). We reviewed the utility of these criteria in patients previously diagnosed as broadly defined undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) and noted overlapping IPAF findings. Additional review was given to IPAF patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on histopathology or radiology in terms of survival and outcome., METHODS: Patients with prior UCTD-interstitial lung disease (ILD) were screened by ERS/ATS criteria for IPAF. Clinical data along with all-cause mortality were collated and compared with selected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients from the same study period. Survival was compared between IPAF subgroups with and without UIP features., RESULTS: One hundred and one UCTD-ILD subjects (91%) evaluated from 2005 to 2012 also met strict criteria for IPAF. Frequent clinical findings included Raynaud's phenomenon, positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern on chest computed tomography (CT). Nineteen had features of UIP either on histopathology or CT imaging. As compared with IPF, IPAF patients had overall better survival except in those with UIP features., CONCLUSION: Current IPAF criteria encompassed the majority of broadly defined UCTD-ILD and included those with UIP findings. Survival compared with IPF in those with UIP was similar. Further studies are necessary to refine IPAF definitions for clinical use and guide directed management strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) with autoimmune features that does not fulfil connective tissue disease (CTD) criteria has been recently defined as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). However, its long-term clinical course and outcome are poorly understood., METHODS: We included consecutive patients diagnosed with IIP (n = 586) or CTD-related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD, n = 149). Some patients with IIP were reclassified as IPAF based on recent guidelines., RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 45 months. Among the IIP patients, 109 (18.6%) were reclassified as IPAF. Compared to the non-IPAF-IIP group, the IPAF group had slower diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO ) and total lung capacity declines, and more frequent CTD development during follow-up periods. The prognosis of the IPAF was better than that of the non-IPAF-IIP and similar to that of the CTD-ILD. IPAF was associated with better prognosis in the IIP cohort on univariate but not on multivariate analysis. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, old age and low DLCO independently predicted mortality in the IPAF group., CONCLUSION: Compared to the non-IPAF-IIP group, the IPAF group had slower lung function declines and more frequent CTD development during follow-up. Although the prognosis of IPAF group was better than that of non-IPAF-IIP group and similar to that of CTD-ILD group, it showed poor prognosis in patients with old age, UIP pattern, and low DLCO .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who show features related to autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease are categorized as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). The present study compared clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with IPAF to patients with connective tissue disease related-interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)., METHODS: ILD patients who were consecutively enrolled in a single institution ILD cohort between 2008 and 2015 were evaluated for the study. Clinical data had been prospectively collected, while radiologic imaging and pathologic findings were re-reviewed for the present study., RESULTS: Out of 305 patients with ILD, 54 (17.7%) patients met the classification of IPAF, 175 (57.4%) patients had IPF, and 76 (24.9%) patients were diagnosed with CTD-ILD. Compared to IPF, incidences of acute exacerbations in 1,3 and 5 years were significantly less in the IPAF group (p = 0.022, p = 0.026 and p = 0.007, respectively). From multivariate analysis for mortality, age (p = 0.034, HR 1.022, 95% CI: 1.002-1.044), FVC (p < 0.001, HR 0.970, 95% CI: 0.955-0.984), ILD exacerbation (p = 0.001, HR 2.074, 95% CI: 1.366-3.148), and ILD type (p = 0.047, HR 0.436, 95% CI: 0.192-0.984 (IPAF vs IPF), respectively) showed significant association., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the other ILD groups, IPAF showed distinct clinical characteristics. The IPAF group showed better survival and less episodes of exacerbation when compared to the IPF group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe the clinical manifestations and survival of patients with ILD and myositis-specific and associated autoantibodies, and to evaluate the performance of the new ATS/ERS classification criteria for IPAF., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ILD and positive in at least one of the following autoantibodies: anti-Jo-1, anti-Ej, anti-PL7, anti-PL 12, anti-PM/SCL 75 and anti-PM/SCL100 were included. Patients were separated into three groups according to their autoantibody profile: 1. Jo-1 positive patients, 2. Non-Jo-1 antisynthetase autoantibody positive patients, and 3. PM/SCL positive patients. Relevant clinical characteristics were registered. Patients were evaluated had they fulfilled Bohan and Peter's criteria (BPC) for inflammatory myopathies. We evaluated the performance of the IPAF ATS/ERS proposal to classify as such the patients that did not fulfilled BPC, and evaluated whether IPAF patients had a worse survival that BPC patients., RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included. Jo-1 was the most frequent autoantibody (65%), followed by non Jo1 anti-synthetase autoantibodies (31%). Non-Jo1 patients had lower Creatin Kinase serum levels at the baseline and less frequency of arthritis. Only 50% of patients fulfilled BPC. All patients not complying with BPC did comply with IPAF criteria. There was no difference in survival between IPAF and BPC patients. Anti Jo-1 positive was associated to survival and the extent of lung inflammation was associated to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Patients differ in clinical manifestations according to the autoantibody profile. All patients not complying with BPC did comply with the new IPAF criteria. There was no difference in survival between BPC and IPAF patients. Jo-1 patients had a better survival. Extent of lung inflammation was associate to mortality. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) may have features of connective tissue disease (CTD), but lack findings diagnostic of a specific CTD. A recent European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society research statement proposed criteria for patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). We applied IPAF criteria to patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and undifferentiated CTD-ILD (UCTD). We then characterised the clinical, serological and morphological features of the IPAF cohort, compared outcomes to other ILD cohorts and validated individual IPAF domains using survival as an endpoint.Of 422 patients, 144 met IPAF criteria. Mean age was 63.2 years with a slight female predominance. IPAF cohort survival was marginally better than patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but worse than CTD-ILD. A non-usual interstitial pneumonia pattern was associated with improved survival, as was presence of the clinical domain. A modified IPAF cohort of those meeting the clinical domain and a radiographic or histological feature within the morphological domain displayed survival similar to those with CTD-ILD.IPAF is common among patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and UCTD. Specific IPAF features can identify subgroups with differential survival. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and determine whether patients meeting IPAF criteria benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. Copyright ©ERS 2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases are heterogeneous, and patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia (CFIP) often have clinical, serologic, and morphologic features suggestive but not diagnostic of connective tissue disease. Recently, the concept of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has been proposed as a platform for such patients. However, the prognostic role of IPAF, including the cumulative incidence of acute exacerbations (AEs), is not fully clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features and prognostic significance of IPAF., METHODS: The clinical characteristics and prognostic relevance of a diagnosis of IPAF were retrospectively explored in 194 patients with CFIP, including 163 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 31 with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), in our interstitial lung disease database., RESULTS: Sixteen percent of patients with CFIP (8% of IPF, 61% of NSIP) met the criteria for IPAF. Patients with IPAF were significantly younger and included a higher proportion of women, never-smokers, and patients with NSIP than those without IPAF. The morphologic domain was the most common in patients with IPAF (97%), followed by the serologic domain (72%) and clinical domain (53%). CFIP patients with IPAF had a more favorable prognosis with regard to overall survival (OS; P<0.001, log-rank test) and incidence of AEs (P=0.029, Gray's test) than those without IPAF. In the subgroup analysis, NSIP patients with IPAF had significantly better survival than those without IPAF (P=0.031, log-rank test), and IPF patients with IPAF tended to have better OS than those without IPAF (P=0.092, log-rank test). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs between patients with IPAF and those without IPAF in the IPF and NSIP subgroups. Furthermore, fulfilment of the IPAF criteria was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.127; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.017-0.952; P=0.045) and incidence of AEs (HR 0.225: 95% CI 0.054-0.937; P=0.040)., CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of IPAF might predict a favorable prognosis and less risk of AEs in patients with CFIP.
